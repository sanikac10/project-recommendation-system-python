System user always needs a faster, cheap and reliable process which is conducted by it computer system self. To fulfill that process is required how a computer works from their design and how they operate. That course is conducted by Computer Architecture and Organization (CAO) course. Two computer undergraduate area which studies CAO is Computer Engineering (CE) and Computer Science (CS). To support great learning at CAO both CE and CS needs to not just study which has a material course but they had to practically study computer architecture and design by the simulator. Why simulator is chosen, because to create computer such as CPU, RAM etc. needs big systems that can manufacture them. Nowadays too much freely available simulator that can be downloaded and used anytime, but not all simulators meet study requirements and didn't meet the CAO Learning Outcome. CS and CE have an international curriculum that given by ACM Computing Curricula. So this paper is discussed what kind of simulator that meets Computing Curricula requirement to implement at learning process which helps the instructor to choose simulator that can be able to grasp knowledge that delivered to the student.","[Computer Organization and Architecture, Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Simulator]","[Organizations, Computer science, Standards organizations, Multicore processing, Instruction sets]","[computer aided instruction, computer science education, digital simulation, educational courses, software engineering, teaching]",25-Dec-17,IEEE

The reason for this phenomenon is because they lack the computer system perspective and cannot integrate the knowledges of different courses. To solve this problem, we opened a new course computer system fundamentals (CSF) aiming to enable the students to understand how each statement of the C program realizes its functionality by assemble codes (ACs), how these ACs are converted into the machine codes (MCs), how the MCs are stored in the memory system, how these MCs are loaded into CPUs, and how the CPUs execute the MCs. This course can help the students integrate the knowledge of programming, assembly, machine code, instruction set, digital logic and circuits, thereby making them establish a full-stack computer system perspective, build the hardware and software co-optimization thinking, and also improve the ability to solve the complex engineering problems.

On the contrary, different models should be proposed according to the features of different types of viruses. This article proposed a computer virus propagation model to describe those viruses spreading through the P2P file-sharing network. This model took the files in the network as subjects instead of the computers,which are always adopted in the traditional models. It also introduced the notion of hot degree and file-type suitability degree over the sharing files to illustrate the virus propagation more specifically. Valuable conclusions we regained from the model.

Teleological computer graphics modeling,A. H. Barr,"Computer Graphics Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, USA",Proceedings. 1991 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,06-Aug-02,1991,"Summary form only give. Teleological modeling, a developing approach for creating abstractions and mathematical representations of physically realistic time-dependent objects, is described. In this approach, geometric constraint-properties, mechanical properties of objects, the parameters representing an object, and the control of the object are incorporated into a single conceptual framework. A teleological model incorporates time-dependent goals of behavior of purpose as the primary abstraction and representation of what the object is. A teleological implementation takes a geometrically incomplete specification of the motion, position, and shape of an object, and produces a geometrically complete description of the object's shape and behavior as a function of time. Teleological modeling techniques may be suitable for consideration in computer vision algorithms by extending the current notions about how to make mathematical representations of objects. Teleological descriptions can produce compact representations for many of the physically derivable quantities controlling the shapes, combining-operations, and constraints which govern the formation and motion of objects.<>",,"[Computer graphics, Mathematical model, Mechanical factors, Geometry, Shape control, Laboratories, Rendering (computer graphics), Visualization, Solid modeling, Computer vision]","[computer graphics, computer vision]",06-Aug-02,IEEE

As part of this effort, the computer science faculty members have integrated modules of the NSF/IEEE-TCPP Curriculum Initiative on PDC (Parallel and Distributed Computing) into department-wide core and elective courses offered on fall 2014. These courses are: csc 119 Object Oriented Programming (core), csc 216 Computer Architecture and Organization (core), csc 312 Advanced Computer Architecture (elective), csc 325 Operating Systems (core), csc 350 Organization of Programming Languages (core) and csc 425 Parallel Computing (elective). The inclusion of the PDC modules was gradual and light weighted in the low level courses and more aggressive in the high level courses. Csc 119 Object Oriented Programming provided students with an early introduction to Java Threads: how to create and use. In csc 216 Computer Architecture and Organization students learned about GPUs and were asked to write simple problems using CUDA. Csc 312 Advanced Computer Architecture covered Instruction level and Processor level Parallelism. For csc 325 Operating Systems, mutual exclusion problems and Parallel Computing and Algorithms were introduced. In csc 350 Organization of Programming Languages, students learned about the implementation of threads in Java. Csc 425 Parallel Computing is an advanced study of parallel computing hardware and software issues. Assessment results showed that student perception of PDC concepts was satisfactory with some weakness in writing parallel code. However, students were very excited and motivated to learn about PDC.

Historically, students were exposed to computer architecture's hardware-centric concepts through traditional textbook publisher provided instructor materials, including system schematic and block diagrams, and cycle-by-cycle hand analysis of short assembly language code snippets. Recorded student achievement outcomes for the course, were just meeting the faculty defined levels. Analysis of student performance indicated a higher-level of course content understanding in students with a mix of both hardware and software skills, and lower achievement levels by those students with only software background and skills. In an attempt to improve overall student understanding and outcome achievement, a reform of course material presentation was initiated which focused on use of microbenchmark programming as a means of introducing selected computer hardware concepts through their programming interfaces. Most computer science students are good programmers and understand high-level languages and algorithms. As such, they are used to tackling new concepts with software, so it was hoped that by linking the instruction of computer architecture hardware concepts with a programmer's perspective, overall student understanding and outcomes would improve.","[computer architecture, computer science education, computer performance]","[Computer architecture, Hardware, Benchmark testing, Pipelines, Programming, Software, Computers]","[computer architecture, computer science education, educational courses, educational institutions, programming]",14-Apr-16,IEEE

It is based on parallel processing done on multiple graphics processing units (GPUs). An eigenspace image recognition approach is implemented on this parallel graphics architecture. This paper discusses methods of mapping computer vision algorithms to run efficiently on multiple graphics devices to maximally utilize the underlying graphics hardware. The additional memory and memory bandwidth provided by the graphics hardware provided for significant speedup of the eigenspace approach.

This school of thought does not realize that by this, it will take CE program apart from CS program, which will break the natural alliance of both of these programs. In this paper, this natural alliance of CE and CS programs is discussed, which gives strong argument that both CE and CS programs should be put together under the same college. To further support these arguments of putting CE and CS programs together, the best practices adopted in this regards by the top 10 universities in KSA, USA, UK and other European Universities are studied and results are provided to prove that CE and CS programs should be put together under the same college. Since, this is the current debate at AlBaha University in Saudi Arabia (KSA), therefore the case of AlBaha University is presented to settle the argument.","[undergraduateprograms, computer engineering, computer ccience, computing education, best practices, student success]","[Computer science, Information systems, Electrical engineering, Information technology, Artificial intelligence, Best practices, Hardware]","[computer science education, educational institutions, further education, teaching]",30-Oct-17,IEEE

Since the skill to use computer has been regarded as one of the three basic capabilities in the 21th century, students have to learn computer courses ever from primary school. But the traditional method to teach computer in college that too much attention used to be paid to abstract concepts and boring theories, has been proven to be impractical according to the feedback collected from workplaces. Therefore, it is agreed that greater importance should be attached to the skills that are necessary in workplaces so as to improve studentspsila abilities to use computer, communication appliances and applied software as well as to design software and hardware. In this study, a novel Task-Driven strategy (TDS) for computer major teaching is proposed. This strategy enables undergraduates to better prepare themselves for future complicated tasks, rather than provide them with fragmentary and partial knowledge. In addition, it can help build up the studentspsila sense of achievement, and make computer education more interesting and attractive. This strategy, which provides enough chances for students to learn from near-real tasks, will pave the way to show undergraduates the whole work procedure from an integrated viewpoint, improve their capabilities to learn knowledge and to solve problems independently.

However, except for static measures of real-time behavior, quantizing the dynamic change of varying training periods to evaluate the rehabilitation progress is nontrivial in the clinic. In this paper, we proposed a computable method to compare the motion change of the upper limb. We first used OpenPose to preprocess the video data to recognize the joint points of the upper limb, and described the position of each joint point by Cartesian coordinates. Second, we used the dynamic time warping algorithm to compute the similarity of the limb’s lift angle and time in varying training periods to obtain the rehabilitation progress. The results show that our method can achieve data measurement and analysis of the quality of rehabilitation actions by a simple monocular camera, which has a good application prospect.","[rehabilitation progress, computer vision, OpenPose, motion analysis]","[Training, Computer vision, Heuristic algorithms, Dynamics, Medical services, Stroke (medical condition), Streaming media]","[computer vision, handicapped aids, medical robotics, patient rehabilitation, robot kinematics]",18-Jul-22,IEEE

To reduce the need of security expertise for network administrator, yet performing security risk management, this paper proposes UML models to represent expert's security information. We propose a UML class diagram which is built up of necessary classes for security analysis of networks. These classes are the building blocks needed for estimation of probability and effects of security threats. This model is created once and represents the security information needed for analysis. To analyze any network, the needed objects should be instantiated from the provided classes. These objects form the security model of the network with all the threats and their risks specified in. To instantiate the objects of network security model, its information is needed. This information is usually available in documents of a network or is obtainable via automated scanners. We show the applicability of the proposed model on a test network. As the result, the security model of the network which contains its security threats and also their risks are obtained.","[security threat, analysis model, computer network, risk estimation, bayesian network, UML model]","[Unified modeling language, Security, Analytical models, Computers, Computational modeling, Web servers]","[computer network management, computer network security, probability, risk analysis, Unified Modeling Language]",02-Jan-17,IEEE

Student Success Analysis from Running a Pre-College Computer Science and Math Summer Program,J. Raigoza,"Computer Science Department, California State University, Chico, Chico, USA",2021 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE),20-Dec-21,2021,"This Research to Practice Work in Progress Paper studies the high attrition rate problem of first-time computer science Freshmen students at most universities. The problem is worsened given the growing demand of Information Technology workers and due to the limited instruction of computer science related content being taught within the high school education curriculum. The result is that incoming college students who are majoring in computer science or in related STEM fields are unprepared. Additionally, the means to adequately meet the employment demand is less likely with the low percentage of workers from under-represented minority (URM) groups in jobs within the computer science related industry. Much research has been done on predicting and improving student's success, particularly with the first programming and algorithms course known as CS1 and being ready to take Calculus. The problem is difficult to understand due to the many factors that exists, such as students having different education backgrounds, not knowing what a computer science education entails, and student support systems at a new school. At our university, for three summers, we offered our incoming engineering students a pre-college 4-week summer experience to better prepare them for their first year. The student population targeted were from under-represented minority groups, first-generation, low-income, and women. The goal of the program was to better prepare the students for success by engaging and advising them with both, computer science and math content by bringing them together as a cohort, which is essential during their first critical year in a computer science engineering field of study. The goal of this paper is to study the attrition rates and gain insight on student success predictors for entering Computer Science students. Research has shown that pre-college programs can benefit student success. By targeting students from underrepresented minority groups our summer program integrates computer science and math concepts to better prepare students for “Day 1” of college. The research work employs the student involvement theory to promote student success and retention. With COVID-19 restricting students to online learning, challenges in student-faculty and student-student contact have significantly made an impact. In addition to online survey/interview data, math and computer science course completion rates were collected from our 87 summer cohort participants to compare with the rest of the students. Triangulation of all the data collected yielded some insights and confirmed others on predictors for student success and persistence. Specifically, the summer students were disproportionately affected by COVID-19, compared to the general population (i.e., they were readily not able to collaborate with their peers and approach faculty).","[retention, summer program, computer science, COVID-19, student success]","[Computer science, COVID-19, Sociology, Education, Prediction algorithms, Pre-college engineering, Statistics]","[computer aided instruction, computer science education, educational courses, educational institutions, engineering education, gender issues, student experiments]",20-Dec-21,IEEE

Self-administered questionnaires were randomly distributed to employees in commercial banks in Kuala Lumpur, generating 319 responses for the final analysis. The findings indicate that computer skills and acceptance in using technology are inversely related to computer anxiety. Hierarchical regression analysis reveals that both low and high attitudes towards computers show a negative relationship between computer skills, computer knowledge and computer anxiety. Empirical evidence explains the variation of the study and supports the view that the scale used in the western workplace environment is also applicable in Malaysia. The study suggests computer users have to keep up with and adapt to new technology and its applications since computer anxiety is a natural consequence of performing heavy, routine job tasks.","[Computer anxiety, attitude towards computer, computer skills and computer knowledge]","[Computers, Computational modeling, Computer applications, Educational institutions, Business, Employment]","[computer literacy, human factors, office environment, personnel, regression analysis]",12-Jul-12,IEEE

Systems users are always in need of faster, more powerful, yet cheaper computer systems. This calls for an understanding of the processor-level components of computer systems, their design and operation, and their impact on the overall performance of the systems. To fulfill this requirement the course on Computer System Design and Architecture has been introduced in the 3rd semester. Earlier, there were two courses offered with titles “Computer Organization” in Semester 3 and “Advanced Computer Architecture” in Semester 8. These two courses were not related and there existed a gap of 4 semesters in learning of these two courses. Students were unable to appreciate the architecture related concepts in other courses of lower semesters. As mentioned in IEEE SWEEBOK curriculum recommendations, a wide semantic gap exists between the computer's intended behavior and the workings of the underlying electronic devices that actually do the work within the computer. This gap is bridged through Computer Organization. On the other hand Computer Architecture is the course that specifies the relations and parts of a computer system and it deals with mainly three elements viz. Instruction Set Architecture, Computer Organization and Hardware. Accordingly, a course on Computer System Design and Architecture which combines the study of Computer Organization and Computer Architecture is designed to be offered at semester 3. The next challenge came in the form of delivery of the course. Since a detailed conceptual understanding of computer organization and architecture is required, which was not possible only with classroom delivery, self study activity was introduced which provided ability to the students to compare various processor architectures, their functionality and visibility to information processing. This continuous process helped them acquire knowledge, values, skills and understanding that they will require throughout their lifetime.","[Organization, Architecture, Hardware]","[Computers, Computer architecture, Organizations, Industries, Hardware, Computer science, Manufacturing processes]","[computer architecture, computer science education, educational courses, instruction sets, teaching]",06-Mar-14,IEEE

This type of attack can lead to data breaches, and with it to image and financial loss in a company. The most common technique to exploit this type of attack is by sending emails to the target users to trick them to send their credentials to the attacker servers. If the user clicks on the link from the email, then good detection is needed to protect the user credentials. Many papers presented Computer Vision as a good detection technique, but we will explain why this solution can generate lots of false positives in some important environments. This paper focuses on challenges of the Computer Vision detection technique and proposes a combination of multiple techniques together with Computer Vision technique in order to solve the challenges we have shown.

How to improve communication between students and teachers is being more important. The ubiquity of mobile phones provides a new communication platform for students and teachers. In order to strengthen communication between students and teachers, we design the computer-aided education platform based on mobile communication and cloud computing technology. In client, we develop the smartphone software based on the open source JavaME UI framework (kuix) and Jaber which is an open source instant message protocol. In order to help teacher use the system conveniently, we develop the web site based on Google App Engine. Through the communication platform, the students can communicate with their teacher at any convenient time. This helps teachers know the situation of teaching and student's knowledge level of the course. The teacher also can answer questions or send messages to students through this communication platform freely.

The former are mandatory and students must pass them all so they can achieve Bachelor degree. The number of the latter is usually several times greater than the number that a student should select. This challenges the student which elective courses to select. Some elective courses have prerequisites, so the student has to pass other (elective) course(s), while for many others the student can be enrolled in without any prerequisites. The main dilemma for the student is whether to enroll in either more tightly coupled elective courses, or more loosely coupled elective courses. Choosing the former, the student will be directed in more specific areas of computer science. However, there are students that would like to learn broad areas of computer science. This paper focuses on the emerged group of students that select interdisciplinary courses.

Computer display is a kind of important electronic device. The traditional method of detecting electromagnetic information leakage from computer displays is to reconstruct original image. It is necessary for reconstruction technology to understand the working mechanism of the detected equipment and other relevant information. However, this process tends to be complex so that it is hard to realize the detection. This paper proposes a classification detection method based on Machine Learning. It can detect electromagnetic information leakage by classifying and identifying the electromagnetic information radiated from computer display equipment. In experiment, we preprocess electromagnetic signal through Wavelet Transform, design a three-layer convolutional neural network, classify the samples correctly. The detection method based on Machine Learning overcomes the technical drawback that traditional detection methods need to reconstruct. We compare with other common Machine Learning algorithms.

Accordingly, graduates have some kind of tunnel vision because they have been trained to think of digital computation as a panacea for all problems encountered in real life.As digital computing is nearing basic physical boundaries with respect to integration densities and energy consumption it is important to extend the curriculum in computer science to include unconventional computing approaches such as analog computing.1 Therefore it is necessary to give students and hobbyists as well the opportunity to get some hands-on-experience with analog computers. Since classic analog computers have become museum pieces, there is a need for a modern cheap and small analog computer, which can be used not only for teaching analog computer programming but can also be used in mathematics education to give students an intuitive grasp of dynamic systems and differential equations. Other fields of application are the engineering sciences, life sciences and basically all fields of technology where differential equations play a crucial role.This paper describes such an analog computer, called THE ANALOG THING, which has been developed to satisfy the above requirements. This analog computer is cheap (about 300 EUR) and versatile. Several of these computers can be coupled together to form a larger machine, and can also be used as part of a hybrid computer setup.

Software developers need suitable criteria to handle computer interfaces because of the diversity within the `digital population' and it seems natural that educators should answer the professional questions posed by software designers. In this paper we report on the experience of a vocational course on object-oriented design, which - among other topics - provides professional criteria to students who are required to plan a large assortment of computer interfaces from panels to object lists, from animated images to social web pages. In the first stage, lessons on HCI illustrate the psychological portraits of computer users. Second, the lessons deduce practical guidelines from those profiles. Finally the students learn the technical contents regarding HCI design. The concise psychological and social criteria which guide the students to prepare the visual interfaces constitute the innovative contribution of the present work at the didactic level. The initial lessons on HCI go beyond mere technical training and it may be said that they improve the professional culture of students.

Therefore, it is important that computer games for children are well-designed and usable for the children. In order to evaluate the usability of the computer game, children must be observed while exploring and playing the game and given the chance to express their opinions. Therefore, to involve children effectively, appropriate evaluation techniques are needed. This paper will discuss an observation method that has been adopted in a usability testing with the children. In this study, a computer game called Jelajah is chosen as the game to be tested for the usability evaluation with children. Jelajah is suitable for the experiment because it is an adventure game which is a very common game genre for children. Five preschool children aged between five and six years old are selected for this study. During the usability testing session, facilitator observes the child and fill in the observation checklist form in order to track the effectiveness and efficiency of the game. After the test session completed, the child is required to answer a simple interview-based questionnaire to know their level of satisfaction after playing the game. Data collected are both qualitative and quantitative. The collected data are analyzed to determine the levels of effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction. The levels of effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction are being measured by averaging them to a single metric that can represent the usability of Jelajah. The result obtained showed that the approach adopted to conduct a usability testing of a computer game with children using Jelajah can also be adopted for evaluating any educational computer game with children.","[Usability, Educational computer game, Observation method]","[Usability, Human computer interaction, Aging, Data analysis, Programming, System testing, Productivity, Costs, Jacobian matrices, User interfaces]","[computer aided instruction, computer games, human computer interaction]",20-May-10,IEEE

High infectiousness and no cure has been found, causing university in most parts of the world to implement lockdowns and implement online distance learning. Some students have difficulty in online practical learning and do not have sufficient materials, such as in computer networking courses. Computer network hardware are not cheap and not all students have it. On the other hand, almost every student has a computer at home. This allows virtualization technology to be carried out at home. This study aims to utilize virtualization technology by using student computers in their respective homes study computer networking courses without having to visit a computer lab during the pandemic. To determine the best virtualization technology, we tested the capabilities of VMWare and Virtual Box in managing and computing guest operating systems. Testing with the same hardware on the host, VMWare performs better in terms of virtualization, both in terms of computing and data transfer through virtual computer networks. Virtual Box's failure to pass the 2D Graphic Mark test demonstrates that it has a limited ability to calculate or render 2D graphics. This will manifest itself later in the slowness with typical Windows actions such as drag & drop and scrolling. Furthermore, computer network programs that rely significantly on 2D capabilities, such as Cisco Packet Tracers and GNS3, would be affected. These findings also become the foundation for the development of further research on the VMM capabilities in managing and running virtual machines.","[virtualization, virtual machine manager, distance learning, VMM, passmark, computer network practicum]","[Graphics, Virtual machine monitors, Pandemics, Operating systems, Data transfer, Computer networks, Virtual machining]","[computer networks, computer science education, distance learning, operating systems (computers), virtual machines, virtualisation]",29-Dec-21,IEEE

The work presented in the paper addresses the problem of craniofacial reconstruction using two popular surface matching algorithms namely the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm and the data aligned rigidity constrained exhaustive search (DARCES) algorithm. The two algorithms are first applied individually and then in combination to achieve the desired reconstruction. The synergistic combination of the DARCES and ICP algorithms is found to yield higher reconstruction accuracy in much shorter execution time compared to the ICP algorithm used in isolation. The local surface irregularities on the fracture surfaces are exploited using a fuzzy set theoretic approach and a curvature-based method. Incorporation of the knowledge of the surface irregularities by means of two reward-penalty schemes in the hybrid DARCES-ICP algorithm is shown to result in robust and accurate surface reconstruction.

In this paper, we study the impact of a novel teaching method, namely the Alice 3D learning environment, proposed elsewhere for teaching computer programming concepts to novice users in an easy and attractive way. We conducted an experiment to measure the effectiveness of Alice by using it to teach programming concepts to first-level students in the Faculty of Computers and Information, Cairo University in the academic year 2008–2009. This was done before introducing them to a high-level language. We then conducted a survey to measure the level of acceptance and benefit attained by the target students. The most important result of our study is that learning with Alice was a beneficial experience to students who have first-time exposure to computer programming. However, Alice was boring to students who have previous programming background.

In this paper, we investigate the issue of professional ability training and evaluation for normal undergraduates majoring in computer science. First, we propose the basic structure of a computer teacher's professional abilities. Then, we discuss the purpose and main contents of the professional ability training as well as the associated approaches. A suggested curriculum for normal computer majors is presented after that. And at last, we propose a set of criteria for professional ability evaluation of the computer majors.","[professional abilities, professional ability training and evaluation, normal education, computer science]","[Training, Computers, Educational institutions, Computer science, Writing, Educational technology]","[computer science education, further education, information technology, training]",23-Jan-12,IEEE

Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs), a brain response observed in EEG, are evoked by flickering stimuli. SSVEP is one of the promising paradigms for BCI. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is widely used for EEG signal processing in SSVEP-based BCIs. However, the classification accuracy of CCA with short signal length is low. In order to solve the problem, we propose a regularization which works in such a way that the CCA spatial filter becomes spatially smooth to give robustness in short signal length condition. The spatial filter is designed in a parameter space spanned by a spatially smooth basis which are given by a graph Fourier transform of three dimensional electrode coordinates. We compared the classification accuracy of the proposed regularized CCA with the standard CCA. The result shows that the proposed CCA outperforms the standard CCA in short signal length condition.","[Brain computer interface, canonical correlation analysis, electroencephalography, regularization, steady-state visual evoked potentials]","[Standards, Electroencephalography, Electrodes, Visualization, Correlation, Optimization, Brain-computer interfaces]","[biomedical electrodes, brain-computer interfaces, electroencephalography, Fourier transforms, medical signal processing, neurophysiology, visual evoked potentials]",18-Oct-16,IEEE

This paper presents a teaching reform plan of computer network course in postgraduate level to reconstruct the curriculum based on different training needs. First, a black box model of academic degree knowledge system is proposed. According to the modular idea of a complex system, an educational degree knowledge system can be decomposed into a series of knowledge modules and further decomposed into some black box components. Each component is similar to the Component Object Model (COM) component in which its external interface describes the functional properties of the element and the inside of the black box component is not visible to this level. For example, undergraduate students should learn the TRACERT command to track the route without knowing the detail of this command while postgraduate students shall know the internal implementation details of TRACERT. This then turns the black box of undergraduate to a white box for postgraduates whereas there is still a lot of knowledge left in the field of computer networks for graduates to learn in their future education. Then the black box model of academic degree knowledge system can be applied to the analysis and determine the computer network course at master level. Then we get our teaching reform program as follows. As an outcome, a syllabus distinguished from undergraduate includes protocol verification analysis and network performance evaluation where the teaching materials are divided into necessary articles and advance articles with the teaching and discussion. The analysis shows that this reform plan can adapt to our teaching to meet the needs of postgraduate students' follow-up work and study.","[Academic Degree Knowledge System, Black Box Model, Postgraduate, Computer Network, Curriculum Construction]","[Computer networks, Education, Protocols, Computational modeling, Knowledge based systems, Computer science, Knowledge engineering]","[computer aided instruction, computer networks, computer science education, educational courses, educational institutions, teaching]",15-Oct-20,IEEE

The application is a Java-based “wizard” that can present and grade short answer questions, multiple choice questions and programming questions for several programming languages (Java, C, Perl, Ruby, Python or bash). The generator, on the other hand, is a web-based application which can be used to create and share tutorials and tests and the wizards which present them. Currently the generator can handle only multiple choice questions and short answer questions with various forms of hints, but it will soon be extended to cover programming questions as well. The generator and test bank are publicly and freely available, so that instructors around the world can share tutorials, tests and results. An instructor can download a ready-made tutorial, add to a current tutorial or create a new one online. We believe that the wizard generator will contribute to improved learning and assessment in programming courses. The more widely it is used, the greater its potential contribution, since the question repositories will grow and become calibrated.","[e-learning, e-assessment, shared learning objects, OER, computer programming, wizard]","[Programming, Java, Tutorials, Computers, Electronic learning, Generators, Educational institutions]","[C language, computer aided instruction, computer science education, educational courses, educational institutions, Internet, Java]",24-Oct-13,IEEE

We describe a feedback-control-based resource manager design approach, allowing the computer system to allocate resources such as CPU and network bandwidth based on the measured ""progress"" of the applications. Progress is measured by separating a complex application into a number of simpler applications separated by buffers. The resource scheduler measures the buffer fill levels to determine whether the rates of data coming in and going out of each buffer are matched. Feedback controllers keep the buffer levels around a certain fill level. We have developed prototype systems in the Linux environment that demonstrate that (classical) feedback control can be used to match the real rates. However, more formal methods, such as those that can be developed by the control theory community, are needed to help with the analysis and design of such systems to make them commercially viable.

The search usually lasts for a few hours and is currently conducted by the naked eyes to search for orange colored life boats from a height of 500 ft. It is a tiresome task and true targets may be missed because of human errors. Therefore we propose to use computer vision techniques to tackle the problem. We suggest that using tracking techniques such as the Kalman combined with the CAMSIDFT algorithm can generate good results. Since the traditional CAMSHIFT algorithm fails in tracking small targets especially when they are moving fast, we propose a new extended CAMSIDFT algorithm with changing window sizes based on the speed of the object being tracked. Additionally, we sample the data in the window with a certain Gaussian distribution to make the tracking more accurate. The experimental result shows that this approach is feasible and is able to track small live boat objects correctly at sea.","[Computer Vision, Sea Search, Kalman Filter, CAMSHIFT]",[Handheld computers],"[aerospace components, aircraft, boats, computer vision, emergency services, Gaussian distribution, image sampling, iterative methods, Kalman filters, marine accidents, marine engineering, object tracking, optimisation, target tracking]",15-Jul-13,IEEE

Formative assessment is necessary for teaching and assessment of complex skills like troubleshooting or network design. Therefore, there exists a need for assessments to capture students' problem solving process and chosen approaches during the assessment.

Then the teacher shows the visual subject or graphic animation on the teacher's instruction screen and instructs students to rewrite (i.e., modify or extend) a similar source code. Students thus have to read source codes carefully and to modify or extend these after repeated trials and errors.

To decrease the calibration time, a shorter data is concatenated to increase the data length for better fit of using CCA.

At present, encryption and network security defense systems are important technical means of security defense. Based on this research background, the paper proposes an AES data encryption scheme in the Hadoop big data environment. The AES algorithm performs several rounds of plaintext encryption through the steps of round key addition, byte replacement, row displacement, column confusion, etc. Under the MapReduce architecture, the plaintext data is divided into multiple data fragments. The Map function is responsible for the AES algorithm encryption operation, and the Reduce function Combine encrypted data information. Finally, the paper designs a computer network security defense system that can actively discover the security threats in the network and effectively prevent them, so as to ensure the normal and safe operation of the network. At the same time, we use the encryption algorithm on the computer network security defense system. Experimental research has proved that this method can safely transmit network data packets. With the increase of computing cluster nodes, its encryption transmission efficiency continues to improve. This solution not only solves the problem of computer network data security encryption, but also realizes the parallel transmission of encrypted data in the information age.","[computer network security, security defense system, influencing factors, prevention, data encryption]","[Conferences, Production, Computer architecture, Information age, Computer industry, Computer networks, Encryption]","[Big Data, computer network security, cryptography, parallel processing]",02-Aug-21,IEEE

As the complexity of these devices increase, the sheer amount of such instructions can easily disrupt, distract and overwhelm users. A novel method to recognize hand gestures for human computer interaction, using computer vision and image processing techniques, is proposed in this paper. The proposed method can successfully replace such devices (e.g. keyboard or mouse) needed for interacting with a personal computer. The method uses a commercial depth + rgb camera called Senz3D, which is cheap and easy to buy as compared to other depth cameras. The proposed method works by analyzing 3D data in real time and uses a set of classification rules to classify the number of convexity defects into gesture classes. This results in real time performance and negates the requirement of any training data. The proposed method achieves commendable performance with very low processor utilization.","[Human Computer Interaction (HCI), gesture recognition, hand gestures, convex hull, convexity defects, computer vision and image processing]","[Gesture recognition, Cameras, Human computer interaction, Real-time systems, Mice, Thumb]","[computer graphics, gesture recognition, human computer interaction, image colour analysis, microcomputers, real-time systems]",18-Aug-16,IEEE

Assuming that each virtual circuit contributes a Poisson stream and message transmission times have exponential distribution, the author determines expressions for mean resequencing delay and average buffer lengths. He assumes that messages belonging to different virtual circuits have different mean lengths. The author considers an infinite number of links connecting S and D. Thus, the results provide an upper bound on the above metrics for nodes connected by finitely many links.

Although such learning contexts may be 'comfortable' and familiar' for some students they do not accord with the learning patterns of many 'capable' computer users.

In addition, it was possible to calculate the position and the velocity of the bob more than 30 times during a single oscillation. Students were able to plot the extra data points for a better understanding of the simple harmonic motion, which was not possible in the manual method. Second experiment was focused on measuring the terminal velocity of a ball moving through a viscous medium. Final case study was on tracking multiple particles in a moving fluid. In all three experiments computer vision based system provided more accurate and higher number of data points than the manual method. This helps students to understanding the underline theory better. The tracking system was consisted of a digital camera, image preprocessing sub system, feature extraction subsystem, object identification subsystem and data export subsystem. The system was successfully tested on a normal PC which is cost effective to be used in high schools. Based on the case studies it was concluded that such systems can be used in high schools to improve the quality of experiments conducted.","[Object tracking, Computer Vision, Physics Experiment, Optical Flow]","[Object recognition, Computer vision, Physics, Cameras, Feature extraction, Tracking]","[cameras, computer aided instruction, computer vision, feature extraction, object detection, object tracking, pendulums, physics education, student experiments, teaching]",25-Dec-17,IEEE

In wearable computing scenarios, hand positioning and tracking is particularly difficult due to complex background, lighting variation and image dithering caused by head movement. This paper proposes a robust hand tracking method for gesture-based interaction of a wearable computer with a visual helmet. The method is an extension of the basic CONDENSATION algorithm, which is able to track hand in dynamic and complex background. Furthermore, the algorithm can recognize the current hand gesture and automatically switch between multiple well-defined gesture templates in the tracking loop.

The effectiveness of the digital world has changed the learner's perceptive towards the education system. The impulsivegrowth of technology has increased the popularity of Information and Communication Technology which has created a research scope in Computer network domain thus Computer network course in the curriculum of Computer Science and Engineering plays an important role. It is always a challenge to teach Computer Networks course to students as the course requires a practical exposure more than the chalk and talk. It is very hard for students to envision the concepts of computer networks, protocols formats and understanding packets flow during teaching in classroom. To overcome above said challenge, pedagogical practice such as active learning through simulation tool is identified in delivery of the course. This paper discusses the effective use of a Packet Tracer (PT) simulation tool in the teaching of computer network concepts. A structured learning approach is introduced by using packet tracer tool in teaching network concepts and series of exercises are designed and developed to give the visualization of each layer functionality. These practical exercises helped in active learning to use the packet tracer to simulate campus network. This pedagogy practice encouraged the students' to build the clarity on the physical devices like router, access points, switch and their configurations. The troubleshooting skills were practiced by introducing the errors deliberately and how to resolve is learnt through the tool. Computer network simulation activity include the concepts of NAT, Subnetting, V-LAN setting, services of TCP/UDP, packet format details, application layer protocol like DNS, DHCP, E-Mail, FTP and HTTP. Activity is evaluated through demos, presentation and quizzes. Rubrics based assessment is followed to ensure uniformity and transparencyin the evaluation. The average marks obtained in quiz by students before using PT tool is 65% and after using tool is 85%, it shows significant improvement of 20% in learning the fundamental concepts of computer network course.","[packet tracer, simulation, network, protocol]","[Computer networks, Protocols, Tools, Network topology, Computational modeling, Topology, Education]","[computer aided instruction, computer literacy, computer networks, computer science education, digital simulation, educational courses, protocols, teaching, telecommunication engineering education]",25-Sep-17,IEEE

A BCI is an alternative or augmentative communication method for people with severe motor disabilities. However, EEG suffers from poor spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To improve the spatial resolution and SNR many researchers have turned to implantable electrodes. We have previously reported on significant improvements in BCI recognition rates using tripolar concentric ring electrodes compared to disc electrodes. We now report on a optimal method for combining the outputs from the independent elements of the tripolar concentric ring electrodes to improve the spatial resolution further. We used minimum variance distortionless look (MVDL), a beamformer, on simulated data to compare the spatial sensitivity of the optimal combination to disc electrodes and the tripolar concentric ring electrode surface Laplacian. The optimal combination shows the highest spatial sensitivity with the Laplacian a close second and disc electrodes resulting in a distant third. Further analysis is necessary with a more realistic computer model and then real signals. however it appears that the optimal combination may improve the spatial resolution of EEG further which in turn can be utilized to improve noninvasive EEG-based BCIs.",,"[Filtering, Electrodes, Brain computer interfaces, Electroencephalography, Laplace equations, Spatial resolution, Muscles, Biomedical computing, Biomedical engineering, Signal to noise ratio]","[array signal processing, biomedical electrodes, brain-computer interfaces, electroencephalography, medical signal processing, spatial filters]",13-Nov-09,IEEE

The existing laboratory infrastructure was insufficient to support this additional load and we decided to introduce a laptop based mobile lab to satisfy the increased computer hardware and lab space requirements. We describe the steps taken to implement the lab and present the analysis of the results and the problems encountered during the two-year usage of this new teaching environment.",,"[Mobile computing, Computer science, Educational institutions, Portable computers, Education, Laboratories, Wireless networks, Java, Information science, Hardware]","[computer science education, laboratories, educational courses, educational institutions]",18-Apr-05,IEEE

While traditional human-to-human play still remains an important form of game play, amateur players, along with some professional players, have shifted the play domain from “off-line” club houses to “on-line” Go servers. Computer Go is an important field of study to develop a software to play Go or a Go engine. In addition to human-to-human play, a Go engine or computer intelligence to play Go adds another axis to play configuration: human-to-computer play and computer-to-computer play. These revolutions in the game of Go happened in an extremely short period of time compared to the history of the game, which is more than 4,000 years.

AirTouch uses computer vision techniques to extend commonly used interaction metaphors, such as multitouch screens, yet removes any need to physically touch the display. The user interacts with a virtual plane that rests in between the user and the display. On this plane, hands and fingers are tracked and gestures are recognized in a manner similar to a multitouch surface. Many of the other vision and gesture-based human-computer interaction systems presented in the literature have been limited by requirements that users do not leave the frame or do not perform gestures accidentally, as well as by cost or specialized equipment. AirTouch does not suffer from these drawbacks. Instead, it is robust, easy to use, builds on a familiar interaction paradigm, and can be implemented using a single camera with off-the-shelf equipment such as a webcam-enabled laptop.

Linking service quality to perceived operator-computer contribution in customer services,A. -C. Chen,"Department of Industrial Engineering and Management, Ming-Chi University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan",The 40th International Conference on Computers & Indutrial Engineering,13-Dec-10,2010,"In modern service settings, customer service personnel are mostly facilitated with support computer systems for them to elicit and process information while interacting with customers. It is obvious that the perceived quality for such customer service tasks should be a reflection of the integrated performance of this operator-computer system that customers are actually interacting with in service encounters. From the ergonomic point of view, the performance of such operator-computer systems may greatly be influenced by the usability of support computer systems. Contemporary practices in service quality management tend to focus on the evaluation/control on the performances of service personnel. Little attention was, however, devoted to the investigation on the roles of the support information systems as needed. Therefore for the management and design of such service systems, it is valuable to understand customer perceptions on the roles/contributions of operator versus computer to the service quality perceived. This study aims to investigate customer perceptions on the connections of service quality with the perceived operator-computer contributions. A questionnaire survey to the customers of the call centers for both financial/banking and telecommunication services in Taiwan was conducted.

We present results from a preliminary study aimed at exploring this question. Three subjects used hand motor imagery in an electroencephalographic (EEG) BCI while simultaneously using a joystick to control a cursor. Particular attention was paid to preventing potential muscle artifacts from influencing imagery-based control. All three subjects were able to use the hybrid “imagery+joystick” mode of control over two days, demonstrating the ability to learn and significantly improve performance.

Zhang,"College of Information Science & Technology, Department of Computer Science and Technology, State Key Lab of Intelligent Technology and Systems, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China",9th IEEE International Conference on Cognitive Informatics (ICCI'10),11-Oct-10,2010,"In object recognition (classification), it was known that the human brain processes visual information in semantic space mainly, that is, extracting the semantically meaningful features such as line-segments, boundaries, shape and so on. But by recent information processing techniques, these kinds of features cannot be detected by computers robustly so that in computer vision it's still difficult to process visual information as humans do. Computers have to process visual information in data space formed by the robustly detectable but less meaningful features such as colors, textures etc. Therefore, the processing methodology in computers is quite different from that in human beings. In the talk, we will address the main principle of the image recognition (classification) approach in computer vision, its seedtime, main results and the difficulty faced recently. From digital cameras, there is a huge amount of 2D-image data. In computer object recognition (or classification), the data should be transformed into an object-invariant inner representation. In order to solve the problem, we need two key techniques, i.e., a robust detector and an invariant descriptor. People have attempted to solve the two key techniques for a long time but so far they didn't find any efficient solution. Human visual performances are still superior to that of computer vision greatly in many aspects. So as a future direction, computer vision should learn some things from neuroscience and brain science. We will discuss what computer vision can learn from human vision and how it will be affected by the new interdisciplinary research. We may still face many difficulties in the future.","[computer vision, human vision, object recognition, feature, detector, descriptor]","[Computer vision, Humans, Feature extraction, Computers, Visualization, Object recognition, Robustness]","[computer vision, feature extraction, image classification, object recognition]",11-Oct-10,IEEE

Augmented reality (AR) techniques were applied to assist student accessing the videos of historical figures while reading a printed textbook. Whenever a student was interested in a historical figure, one could use a tablet PC to scan the figure's picture, and the corresponding video about the person would then be played on the screen. We adapted thirteen videos of historical figures in computer network field and adopted a quasi-experimental method to evaluate the effectiveness of the AR-based learning approach. Two classes of high school students, with a total of 84 students, participated in the experiment. One class of the students used Tablet PCs to access the videos of historical figures, and the other class using traditional didactic instruction served as the control group. The data collected for analysis are students' achievement test scores and answers to a questionnaire, which consists of questions on attitudes toward learning, perspectives of nature of science, and perceptions on the AR activities. Our findings showed that the AR-based historical figure videos helped students comprehend learning contents and promoted their attitudes toward learning. Students appreciated the convenience of using AR tools to access the history videos. Future research should investigate other approaches to integrate AR with the videos of historical figure, and in general, to integrate AR with other media format of computing history.","[history of computing, videos, historical figures, augmented reality]","[Videos, History, Education, Computers, Augmented reality, Context, Computer networks]","[augmented reality, computer aided instruction, computer science education, notebook computers]",18-Jun-15,IEEE

Traditional introductory courses take a constructive approach to logic design and computer organization. 3030, in contrast, introduces the major physical concepts underlying computation. It shows how they determine basic properties of computers such as speed and energy consumption. It also explores design trade-offs by showing how changes that improve one type of property inevitably, due to physics, cause another useful property to degrade. The course emphasizes CMOS but many of its principles apply to other logic technologies as well. Students do not directly design logic or learn assembly language-for example, delay and energy consumption are studied for inverter chains. However, they have time in the course to study in detail the basic physical phenomena that underlie design choices in digital systems. Those principles help students absorb material in later classes such as VLSI design. 3030 introduces certain topics to students much earlier in the curriculum than is traditional. We believe that an early introduction to principles is important not just for students who become logic designers but for all computer engineers.","[logic design, computer architecture, delay, energy, reliability]","[Computers, Physics, Delays, Materials, Computer architecture, Reliability, Logic gates]","[computer science education, educational courses, logic design]",19-Dec-13,IEEE

However the node delivery and file system design for the proposed network storage is not in the scope of this paper. We show how the routing loop can be utilized to convert the network delay and processing power of the routers to a virtual storage capacity in the network by keeping data in the network in form of floating IP packets. We call this approach Data Storage Technique on IP Networks (DSTN). In satellite and wireless communications this storage can be referred to as deviceless storage. We formulate the potential storage capacity and discuss the parameters that affect the capacity. We validate the technique by comparing the results obtained from the mathematical model with the results obtained from OpNet Modeler simulation tool.

The number of pixels depends on many factors (How far away is the object? What is the camera resolution? What is the focal length?).

Our strategy represents spaces as polygons, then uses a greedy algorithm to partition the polygons and determine the cameras' locations to provide the desired coverage.

In this regard, this research aims to develop a computer simulation based on a system dynamic approach for mitigating congestion and carbon dioxide emission via a road pricing strategy. Firstly, the identified variables were correlated to understand the behavior of the system. Subsequently, the correlated variables were embedded in the stock-flow diagram based on the system dynamics approach to investigate how a variable affects another variable. Then, the developed model was simulated for evaluating the impact of road pricing strategy in reducing congestion and carbon dioxide emission.

In case of learning languages its contribution is very important due to the availability of various multimedia tools. Computer assisted language learning (CALL) is a well established area of research. This has lead to a shift of focus from the teacher to the learner by giving the learner a greater level of autonomy. CALL focuses on the receptive skills of reading and listening which are very necessary for learning a language. In this paper we will analyze the features and advantages of CALL. A lot of people do not take up learning languages like Japanese inspite of their interest in that language only due to its entirely different pictographic writing system that is not easy to master. Classroom and textbook teaching alone would not suffice for learning the essential basics of Japanese language. Therefore in this paper we shall also be presenting an e-learning tool that can be used to learn and teach basics of Japanese language in a more interactive manner.,"[e-learning, computer assisted language learning, CALL, .net application, japanese]","[Computers, Writing, Databases, Educational institutions, Electronic learning, Computer science]","[computer aided instruction, natural language processing, teaching]",09-Apr-12,IEEE

This is no surprise, as the students have never actually seen these processes. To reveal what is happening ""under the hood"" of the computer, we have developed a new tool for program animation: the Teaching Machine. It shows an abstraction that captures some of the ways high-level programmers think of machines, by modeling aspects of both the underlying processor and the compiler. As a program executes, the Teaching Machine can show the flow of control through the source code, the evaluation of expressions, and the changing values of data objects in the memory. The Teaching Machine allows considerable flexibility. Views that are not relevant to an example can be hidden. Execution steps can be as large as a complete subroutine call or as small as a single arithmetic operation. Memory can be viewed in any of four different formats, including a box and arrow representation, which allows automatic animation of algorithms on data structures such as linked lists and trees. We have used the Teaching Machine in a number of ways: as an animated blackboard for an instructor to use in the classroom,  as an application that students can use to investigate either canned examples or their own programs,  as an component in a Web tutorial,  and as the centrepiece of a series of tutorial videos.

A Chabot allows a user to ask questions in the same manner that they would address a human. Chatbots are currently being adopted in almost all fields. Our Chatbot aims at bridging the gap between parents and educational Institutions. Proportions of parent contribution ordinarily incorporate the quality and recurrence of correspondence with educators just as investment in organization capacities and exercises. Studies show that Parent's involvement and knowledge in their ward's performance, mainly in colleges is scanty. The main reason could be a communication i.e. either communication gap between teachers and parents, or even communication with their child could be an issue. Most parents are unaware of the happenings at college. This paper focuses on developing a Chatbot that leverages NLP by using the Dialog Flow API to answers parent's queries in the native language (Tamil) thus assisting parents in keeping track of their students' performance at college.

The feasibility of such a system was tested by implementing its benchtop analogue, centered around a commercial, ultra-low power (ULP) digital signal processor (DSP, TMS320C5517, Texas Instruments). A suite of signal processing and BCI algorithms, including (de)multiplexing, Fast Fourier Transform, power spectral density, principal component analysis, linear discriminant analysis, Bayes rule, and finite state machine was implemented and tested in the DSP. The system's signal acquisition fidelity was tested and characterized by acquiring harmonic signals from a function generator.

On average, the system spent 322 ms to process and analyze 2 s of data. Crosstalk (<, -65 dB) and harmonic distortion (~1%) were minimal. Timing jitter averaged 49 μs per 1000 ms. The online BCI decoding accuracies were 100% for both function generator and EEG data. These results show that a complex BCI algorithm can be executed on an ULP DSP without compromising performance.

In this study, we redesigned research methods course for computer science master's students from a traditional lecture style to embrace an active learning approach. The newly-designed curriculum was exercised during Fall 2016 to teach 31 students majoring in computer science. We examined the course using authentic assessment, behavioral observation with its rubric template, and questionnaires. The results indicated that active learning is an effective pedagogy as students' research skills were greatly improved statistically significantly at p-value less than 0.01.

Most of the computer vision algorithms need the computation consisting of two steps-namely arithmetic computation and trigonometric computation. The complexity is mostly by the trigonometric computations, which generates a need for separate algorithms which performs the entire trigonometric task. In this work one well known algorithm called CORDIC (Rotation Digital Computer), another name is digit by digit approach and Volder's calculation has been addressed. In this, a novel processing strategy is utilized which is particularly reasonable for understanding the trigonometric connections associated with plane organize revolution and change from rectangular to polar directions.

The purpose of this project was to develop a prototype human computer interface that projects images onto a tabletop, uses an imaging system to identify hand position over the tabletop in relation to the projected image, detects menu selections of the hand over projected buttons, and takes actions, such as displaying the selected next menu. A prototype was developed using custom LabView programs for generation of images of menu selections to be projected, image processing and control of the system. Hand recognition was simplified by having the user wear a white glove with a black square on the back for the imaging system to search for. Button selection was recognized by holding the hand over a projected menu button for several seconds. The prototype function showed promise. Further testing and development will be necessary toward wider implementation. Such a projected tabletop human computer interface may improve computer derive assistance for elderly people compared to mobile or computer display interfaces.","[computer vision, LabView, assistive technology, hand gesture, cognition, smart desk, old age]",,"[assisted living, geriatrics, human computer interaction, image recognition, user interfaces]",13-Feb-20,IEEE

However, most of these tools have been predominantly academic projects with no long-term usage, it is difficult to create new content for them, and they are usually not useful for assessment.

Results were overwhelmingly positive and students perceived the tool as having significantly improved their learning. However, students criticised the static view of OpenGL output, the lack of formative feedback, and the inability to experiment with OpenGL code.

However, this body of research typically focuses on the implementation or theory of security controls and mechanisms at the application, operating system, network, and physical layers. The user layer, long recognized as the weakest link in the security chain, has had little to no attention paid to it by comparison, especially from a sociotechnical perspective which is fairly new to engineering. With the introduction of new technologies putting modern society in an almost constant state of flux, familiarity with technology is no longer simply a luxury, but almost a necessity. To that end, we propose the development of an educational game to help instill vital engineering skills as well as practical and relevant computer security practices to users who might not necessarily have a technical background. This approach would take advantage of the relatively recent explosion in the popularity of video games and digital distribution platforms such as Steam to reach a wider potential audience base.

During classroom sessions, the instructor had a computer/projector, but students had no computer access. The challenge was to teach programming to students who were not at computers. One technique involved completion of short programming exercises in small heterogeneous teams. A typical two-hour class might consist of several brief periods of instruction interspersed with 10- or 20-minute periods of team work. Teams shared their solutions with classmates using the whiteboard or overhead projector. The instructor demonstrated a working solution using the instructorpsilas computer/projector, and later put it on the class Web site for the studentspsila use. Another active/cooperative learning technique used was a daily quiz, which was completed by the student during class. Students were encouraged to work together on the quiz, or to ask questions about it during class. The quiz was used as an outline and reinforcement of the daypsilas topics, as well as a feedback mechanism for the instructor. Students also found the quizzes helpful as study tools.

Development of sales profit optimization model with the consideration of warranty and final order - A case study in notebook computer,"Hsin Rau,  Yun-Chun Yen","Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Chung Yuan Christian University, Chungli, Taiwan,  Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Chung Yuan Christian University, Chungli, Taiwan",2009 International Conference on Computers & Industrial Engineering,25-Aug-09,2009,"Due to short product life cycle (PLC) in the notebook computer industry, manufacturers or branders need to prepare enough quantity of spare parts for repairs or replacements after the PLC, which is the final order. But very often, the inventory of spare parts being either not enough or too much will cause various kinds of losses. Meanwhile, in these days, longer product warranty length can attract more people to buy products, but it will lead to more efforts to keep more quantities of spare parts for manufacturers or branders. In addition, the sale price of product is also an important factor to affect sales volume. Therefore, there is a trade-off phenomenon between warranty and price for sales volume. This study develops a mathematical model that includes two steps,  one is to develop a profit optimization model that considers the trade-off phenomenon in order to find the best warranty, price and sales volume in the product life cycle,  the other is to calculate the final order after PLC based on sales volume within the PLC and warranty length. This study uses notebook computer as an example to develop the above model. We believe that the model can serve as a planning tool to prepare inventory for the final order of products with different sales volume and warranty.","[profit optimization model, product life cycle, warranty, final order, notebook computer]","[Marketing and sales, Warranties, Programmable control, Costs, Computer industry, Contracts, Computer aided manufacturing, Mathematical model, Inventory management, Manufacturing industries]","[DP industry, inventory management, notebook computers, optimisation, order processing, product life cycle management, production planning, profitability]",25-Aug-09,IEEE

Many, if not all, of these universities use a hands-on approach for computer laboratory access. A number of research studies in the past two decades have been written on the problems presented by the hands-on approach and in turn two alternative approaches have been suggested to address these problems. The problems presented by the hands-on approach have caused a negative impact on both students' performance in their computer programming subjects and the students' throughput rate. The two alternative solutions which have been proposed by many researchers in this field are virtual laboratories and remote laboratories. Due to many challenges which prohibit students' access to computer laboratories as well as the various problems presented by the current hands-on approach to South African universities, this paper has investigated the opportunities presented by the abovementioned alternative solutions.

Seven students (7 men, age: 21-32 years) participated in this study. Under a controlled illuminance environment, the subjects read a novel in printed form or on a tablet computer from any distance. As the subjects were reading, the cerebral blood flow in their prefrontal cortex was measured using near infrared spectroscopy. The study protocol was as follows: subjects (1) mentally counted a sequence of numbers for 30 s as a pre-test to standardize their thinking, (2) read the novel for 10 min using a printed book or tablet computer as a task, and (3) mentally counted a sequence of numbers for 30 s as a posttest. Step (2) was performed in a random sequence. Subjects rested between the two tasks. The results showed significantly increased cerebral activity (increase in regional cerebral blood flow) both during and after reading a novel on a tablet computer compared with reading a printed book. Furthermore, the region around Broca's area was more active when reading on a tablet computer.

While there is no shortage of proposed methods for quantifying how the human eye perceives color differences, it is difficult to apply these perceptual metrics directly to the color images sensed by a computer vision system. The metric developed can be applied to images sensed using color filters (e.g. red, green, or blue) as is often done in computer vision. The metric is defined in terms of the spectral characteristics of the filters and camera and accounts for their noise properties. The color distance function is derived as an estimate of the physical distance between normalized spectral power distributions. Components of this distance are weighted to account for sensor noise properties. A color metric has several possible uses in a computer vision system. The usefulness of the color metric is demonstrated by evaluating its performance on regions of real images.<>",,"[Computer vision, Colored noise, Image edge detection, Color, Physics, Optical reflection, Geometry, Humans, Filters, Cameras]","[colour, computer vision, computerised picture processing, optical filters]",06-Aug-02,IEEE

Feature selection can reduce noisy data, overtraining effects, necessary storage, computational complexity, and can improve the performance of the classifier. Different feature selection methods have been used to achieve these goals. In this study, a new hybrid feature selection method is proposed. It employs a filter bank common spatial pattern for feature extraction and a grey wolf optimization algorithm to search and generate optimal feature subset with performance evaluated by support vector machine classifier. Also, In order to increase the search performance of the proposed feature selection algorithm, a new parallel combined grey wolf and differential evolution optimization algorithm is proposed.

This paper proposes a new mouse control system using a combined classification method from EEG (electroencephalogram) and EMG signals to solve the problem. There should be defined at least four commands, up, down, left, and right, for the mouse control. However, stop command is added in our system for the asynchronous control, especially to off the commands. These commands are derived from a combined classification method from source of control by using the mono-polar of 6 channel EEG signals and EMG signal with masseter muscle. EEG signals are used for the distinctions from left and right or up and down depending on EMG signal where it is used as a toggle operation for which turns on or off the commands and reverses the commands.

In the other two parts, this paper proposes a new method named as region-segmentation, to partition the dial image, only process the useful blocks of dial image, and not process the other areas. This method reduces the computation amount greatly, and improves the processing speed effectively. Then, uses least squares fitting lines method and central projection method to compute scale marks data and detected pointer value. Prove through experiments, this paper accomplishes an intelligent and rapidly dial gauge calibration system.","[computer vision, region-segmentation method, dial gauges, auto-calibration.]","[Application software, Computer vision, Calibration, Motion control, Pixel, Computer errors, Image segmentation, Educational institutions, Humans, Image recognition]","[calibration, computer vision, computerised instrumentation, gauges, image recognition, image segmentation]",22-Dec-08,IEEE

Motor imagery-based brain-computer interfaces analyze spatial patterns from brain signals elicited when the user imagines execution of a specific behavior. One of the ways to obtain such brain signals is with electroencephalography, which measures signals over the scalp. In this paper, we analyzed the brain patterns from when the users performed different motor imagery tasks and applied them to navigate a simulated drone. The drone was controlled asynchronously, with the user's intentions continuously analyzed throughout the entire drone control period. By navigating the drone in two different scenarios using either 4 or 6 control commands and by comparing control performance when controlling the drone with either a BCI or a keyboard, we have shown the feasibility of motor imagery for asynchronous control of drones for both two- and three-dimensional device control.","[brain-computer interfaces, event-related desyn-chronization, motor imagery, drone control, asynchronous control]","[Performance evaluation, Navigation, Scalp, Machine learning, Brain-computer interfaces, Task analysis, Drones]","[brain, brain-computer interfaces, electroencephalography, handicapped aids, medical signal processing, signal classification]",05-Apr-21,IEEE

The representation of quantum register has benefits over classical computing, i.e. the quantum operation allows manipulating qubits in the way that it is impossible in a classical computer. This paper demonstrates the enhancement in terms of solution quality and speed introduced by quantum computation.

It is significant in real time game environment. Even with the use of powerful graphics workstations, a moderately complex virtual environment can involve a vast amount of computation, inducing a noticeable lag into the system. This lag can detrimentally affect the visual effect and may therefore severely compromise the diffusion of the quality of graphics application. This paper introduced to overcome the limitation of conventional technique. Surface attributes such as normal, colors and textures, which are essentials to bring out the beauty of 3D object are preserved and discussed. The first process is to convert the input data into a memory efficient format. Next, the datasets are organized in an octree structure and later the partitioned meshes are kept in secondary memory (hard disk). Subsequently, sub-meshes are simplified using a new variation of vertex clustering technique. In order to maintain the surface attributes, a vertex clustering technique that collapses all triangles in every leaf node using the generalized quadric error metrics is introduced. Unlike any other vertex clustering methods, the knowledge of neighbourhood between nodes is unnecessary and the node simplification is performed independently. Overall, the proposed algorithm is capable in simplifying large datasets with pleasant quality and relatively fast. The system can run efficiently on low cost personal computer with small memory footprint.",,"[Computer applications, Application software, Computer graphics, Computer displays, Virtual environment, Computational modeling, Three dimensional displays, Workstations, Visual effects, Surface texture]","[computer games, computer graphics, pattern clustering]",26-May-09,IEEE

The key of network security and computer technology lies in computer algorithm. Based on the analysis of virtual experiment teaching mode, this paper expounds the application of computer algorithm in experimental modeling. Computer algorithm is a virtual experiment platform system model including computer programming modeling and computer software modeling. The construction of virtual experiment platform model is inseparable from the help of computer algorithm.

In this course, data structures, their main differences, and their usages are explained. However, for computer science students and especially students who do not have programming experiences, learning data structures can be challenging, and many students change their majors if they are not successful in this course. Given the importance of data structures, it is a pressing issue that we need to work to meet student needs and improve computer science education in this area. With technological developments, teaching strategies based on technology are also varying. The student performance is improved at various levels with these strategies. Also, accessing lower price smart devices with lower prices makes previously inaccessible technology, like Augmented Reality (AR), more readily available for students. Therefore, in this paper, we have developed a practice and learning environment for students based on AR and compared AR approach with standard and web-based animation approaches according to students' comments. Results show that the AR approach not only helps students learn data structures better but is also found to be the most exciting approach.

We propose a model that investigates intelligent computer networks stability while specifying its limits. Packet queuing delay affects the performance of the network, and especially its stability. If the network is presented as a dynamic system in block diagram form, we compute a transfer function and determine the quasi-polynomial system. The characteristic polynomial distribution of zeros of complex variable quasi-plane determines the boundaries of the network stability. The approach relies on estimation of the network system’s transfer functions and its quasi-polynomial. Computer network stability is specified by the distribution of zeros of our quasi-polynomial that is the system’s trajectory for arbitrary initial conditions which approach zero as soon as the packets in a router start queuing. Since the quasipolynomials consist of an infinite number of zeros a typical analytical methods cannot be applied here. So, we use graphical methods. Our model indicates that the queuing delays usually occurring in the network performance, do not affect the Web traffic and consequently the network stability on the whole.","[Intelligent computer networks, communication, algorithms, signal processing, Web traffic, queuing theory, quasi polynomials, mathematical model]","[Polynomials, Delays, Asymptotic stability, Computer networks, Stability criteria, Computational modeling]","[computer networks, delays, polynomials, queueing theory, telecommunication traffic]",03-Aug-15,IEEE

Research-level EEG equipment would make the proposed BCI prohibitively expensive for home users. Thus, investigation was made into the utility of inexpensive consumer-grade EEG equipment, as is available for computer-gaming. SSVEPs were elicited using initially a traditional strobe light source and then a set of individual LEDs, as necessary for the simultaneous stimulation of multiple SSVEPs. Clear responses were recorded using the research EEG system for both the strobe and LED sources,  however the consumer system lacked sufficient sensitivity to reliably detect the SSVEPs. Tests with two stimulating LEDs showed that two SSVEPs of differing frequencies be resolved simultaneously, and that the amplitude of the response decreases as the user's gaze is directed further from the stimulating light source.

In addition, we have compared the overall user experience and preference across the two devices. In order to achieve this, we created a mobile-based word game for an Android mobile platform and a web-based version of the same word game for a browser platform. Sixty participants were instructed to complete the tasks on both devices. Our results show that while performance on the computer-based game was significantly better than performance on the mobile-based game, people preferred to play on the smartphone rather than the desktop computer. People preferred smartphones over desktop computers on account of their touch-screen features, portability and ease of use, even though they actually performed the task more efficiently on the desktop computers.","[Smartphone, Mobile, Computer, Performance, Preference, User Experience]","[Computers, Games, Performance evaluation, Mobile communication, Electronic mail, Atmospheric measurements, Particle measurements]","[Android (operating system), computer games, human factors, mobile computing, online front-ends, smart phones, touch sensitive screens]",12-Dec-16,IEEE
Traffic flow confidentiality security service in OSI computer network architecture,R.

Conference Proceedings,06-Aug-02,1990,"Various issues arising in the placement of traffic flow confidentiality service and encipherment, traffic padding, and routing control security mechanisms in the open system interconnection (OSI) reference model architecture are presented. It is suggested that to provide full traffic flow confidentiality service, a pair of encipherment devices should be placed into the physical transmission path of the physical layer. To perform this, an encipherment security mechanism should be applied. It is noted that full traffic flow security is not possible above the physical layer. Limited traffic flow confidentiality service may be made available at the network layer and/or application layer. For this purpose, routing control and/or traffic padding security mechanisms may be applied at the network and/or application layers.<>",,"[Telecommunication traffic, Computer security, Intelligent networks, Open systems, Computer networks, Computer architecture, Communication system traffic control, Information security, Data security, Communication system security]","[computer networks, cryptography, open systems, security of data, telecommunication traffic]",06-Aug-02,IEEE

Therefore, there is a need for an approach using handheld devices which allows interaction with the real environment so that inter-action with 3D scenes would be easier, more natural, accessible, and intuitive. One potential approach is to use Augmented Reality (AR) technologies using mobile devices as it enables intuitive interactions and integrate virtual objects in a real-world view.

Many decision neuroscience studies revealed evidences for, at least in a task of reinforcement learning, the theory of human decision process consisting of two latent strategies: model-based (MB) and model-free (MF) – goal-directed and habitual manner, respectively. Several BCI studies utilized such findings to present how the overall system can be advanced by employing the pre-built fMRI-based neural computational model as a supervisor for constructing an EEG-based latent strategy decoder. However, such a method demands building a supervising model in advance, which is both heavily time-consuming and computationally costly. Additionally, human behavioral experiments may be additionally required for each different task – highly uneconomical. In order to reasonably deliver our perspectives on a solution for the given issues, we first clarify a definition of meta-BCI – any BCI system that is composed of a latent neural strategy decoder along with an intention interpreter. Subsequently, a few distinct attributes of existing meta-BCI systems in comparison to the conventional ones are described. Last but not least, we suggest how the meta-BCI system can be established both computationally and time efficiently by building a latent strategy decoder in a self-supervised manner, along with our future study plan on the meta-BCI in the particular context. Arguably, a well-established meta-BCI would not only allow swift and precise translation of neural signals into, for instance, movement kinematics with low computational cost, but also offer a great potential for efficient and accurate interpretation of various high-level cognitive intentions from neural representations.","[Brain computer interface, electroencephalography, meta-decoder, human reinforcement learning, latent strategy, model-based, model-free, self-supervised learning]","[Neuroscience, Computational modeling, Buildings, Reinforcement learning, Brain modeling, Brain-computer interfaces, Decoding]","[biomedical MRI, brain-computer interfaces, cognition, electroencephalography, learning (artificial intelligence), medical signal processing, neural nets, neurophysiology]",17-Mar-22,IEEE

Due to the lack of women in technology, many efforts are being made to expose girls to computer programming at an early age. Code camp organizers are using the all-girl model to help put participants more at ease and boost their computing confidence. High computer self-efficacy leads to studying computer science, while the stereotypical views of coding as a male subject and lack of ability in girls hinder women from pursuing CS degrees. For this study, a local Northern Virginia University offered two Java programming summer code camps in the summer of 2016, one course as an all-girl class and the other as a co-ed environment. A total of 19 girls participated and submitted post-workshop survey responses. In this paper, we explore the questionnaire differences in response between the girls within the two groups.

The primary function of a poultry farm is to produce meat and eggs. At present, the cost of meat and egg production in our country needs to be further reduced. Proper maintenance of poultry boilers increases meat and egg production. Still, poultry farmers in our country do not have a clear idea about smart poultry farms, so they cannot use innovative technology properly, but developed countries use smart technology. In addition to making more profit at a lower cost, they can meet the demand for animal meat of the people in their country.

An important approach to this issue is to explore usual image statistics. In this way, when the statistical distributions (i.e., histograms) of some types of residual images are established, previous works usually apply operations on these histograms or compute statistical quantities to extract features. However, as the histograms are fundamental resources and can present most image information, the histograms themselves can be directly used as features and we do not need further manipulations on them. Based on this consideration, we simply take several highest histogram bins of the difference images as features to carry out classification, and these simple histogram features work well in terms of both detection accuracy and computational complexity. Actually, experimental results demonstrate that, with only 112 features, the proposed method outperforms some state-of-the-art works.","[Digital forensics, computer generated graphics, photographic images]","[Feature extraction, Histograms, Accuracy, Computers, Conferences, Graphics, Discrete Fourier transforms]","[computational complexity, computer forensics, computer graphics, image classification, statistical distributions]",29-Dec-11,IEEE

Considering a broken object as a subject of treatment, we claim that listening to an object's story provide an aid to its repair. A prominent question emerges hence: how can objects tell their stories? Based on the consideration that an object's story corresponds to its peculiar lifecycle, we are confident that it can be acquired by “observing” how that object is crafted, manipulated and operated along its life. Two sweaters, for example, may be exactly the same at the beginning, but depending on how they have been worn, and on the decay process to which they have been subjected, their correspondent stories may be very different. With this in mind, we have tried to exploit fine gesture recognition algorithms that have been put to good use to capture the stories of unanimated objects that are crafted and then manipulated by human beings. This approach appears very promising when searching for mechanisms capable of automatically understand what objects have to tell to us.","[Repair, storytelling, talking objects, gesture recognition, computer vision, experiments]","[Maintenance engineering, Gesture recognition, Fabrics, Cameras, Trajectory, Computer vision, Medical diagnostic imaging]","[computer animation, computer vision, gesture recognition, maintenance engineering, medical image processing, patient treatment]",03-Oct-13,IEEE

In this paper, we discuss the use of dense borehole pre-drainage technology as a preventive measure for coal and gas outburst. In order to enhance the pre-drainage efficiency and rationally arrange the borehole, the solid-gas coupled RFPA2D-Gas software is used to study the variation regularity in gas pressure and drainage radius under different conditions. These include the coal seam permeability coefficient, the space between boreholes, the borehole diameter, the gas content coefficient and the pre-drainage time. In conclusion, if a large permeability coefficient, a large borehole diameter, a small space between boreholes and a small content coefficient are used in the coal seam, then the reduction in gas pressure and drainage radius will be large. In this case, the shortest pre-drainage time is required in order to avoid the outburst danger in the coal seam. If the pre-drainage time is extended, both gas pressure reduction and drainage radius increase.","[computer simulation, outburst coal seam, dense boreholes, gas pre-drainage, gas pressure, drainage radius, RFPA2D-Gas software]","[Computer simulation, Permeability, Equations, Computer science, Educational institutions, Computer science education, Numerical simulation, Safety, Educational technology, Pressure control]","[coal, digital simulation, disasters, mining, oil drilling, permeability]",01-Sep-09,IEEE

However, most students did not know why they needed to learn binary concepts, and seemed less interested in learning. To enhance the effectiveness of learning, we incorporated some examples corresponding to each binary concept to link students' life experiences to the concepts in order to make learning meaningful. In this paper, we will share our teaching materials for the binary concept from the course ""Introduction to Computers"". The lesson starts from how computer stores values, text or image data to introduce basic concepts of binary data interpretation and hex conversion. Afterwards, a combination of simple logic gates adder instance is introduced to guide students to learn how to perform a binary compute operation. Finally, software CPU simulator is covered to allow students to learn and visualize how computer uses binary data and basic operations to perform some specific compute functions.","[How computer works, binary concept teaching, case-based instruction]","[Computers, Education, Games, Central Processing Unit, Psychology, Logic gates, Concrete]","[computer aided instruction, computer science education, educational courses, educational institutions, teaching]",18-Jun-15,IEEE

For example, they are not confident about their interactions with other people, mainly because they are not sure of other people's expressions, feelings or intentions. In many cases, this situation results in social issues such as isolation and marginalisation among others. The field of computer vision has attempted to provide solutions to some of the problems people with visual impairment face. Currently, computer vision technologies are able to identify almost any element available in our environment. However, most of the recognition processes are trained based on image classification. The current proposal pushes the boundaries of computer vision (henceforth CV) powered by image categorisation by evolving it to the next stage, namely cognitive computer vision. We aim to develop a computer algorithm to enhance machine vision by incorporating a conversational analytic (henceforth CA) approach. This intelligence will be embedded into a hardware device with the objective of providing real-time feedback to visually impaired users via speech output, thus reducing the gap between technology and human-like augmented senses.","[cognitive computer vision, conversation analysis, machine vision, visually impaired]","[Computer vision, Computational modeling, Visualization, Face, Proposals, Cognition, Real-time systems]","[computer vision, handicapped aids, image classification]",30-Dec-18,IEEE

While the virtual platforms are cheaper and more flexible, presenters and meeting hosts are likely less efficient at assessing audience attention and engagement due to the lack of body language. In this paper, we propose a system for estimating and monitoring participant attention in virtual meetings by using computer vision. Our approach mainly focuses on changes in a person’s presence, gaze direction, and head orientation as a computer camera has a limited field of view. We first created a module to detect and extract participant video cells to isolate users and process their attention individually. Using those videos, we then monitored the user’s presence, using YOLOv3 and DeepSORT, and their gaze direction and head orientation, using PTGaze. Through this monitoring, the system is able to record and graph a user’s attention over the total amount of frames and return a collective attention level graph for the entire meeting. We believe that our system has potential usage in settings where attention is critical, such as academic lectures or collaborative business meetings.","[computer vision, gaze estimation, head orientation, attention monitoring, class monitoring]","[Computer vision, Object detection, Magnetic heads, Libraries, Trajectory, Pattern recognition, Internet]","[cameras, computer vision]",04-Oct-22,IEEE

We present how a track of courses and their syllabuses are adapted towards these new emerging technologies, without changing the whole curriculum. There are multiple results of these changes. Students now can choose a track and learn the courses with increased interest,  they can see the ""whole picture"" after finishing all courses of the track,  they prepare more complex projects and they are happier with the changes.

With the recent advancements in Computer Vision and IoT, it is possible to enforce such safety rules without on-ground personnel.

In particular, it can not explain the appearance of certain singularities in intensity of color in the image which are very important features of diffuse ink painting. In our previous work, a model based on physical analysis of paper structure was proposed. Although this model provided an adequate simulation of many diffuse ink painting properties, it was still insufficient to explain the singularities of intensity distribution precisely. Now we solve this problem. A multidimensional diffusion model which we propose proves to provide exactly the same intensity distribution as in real images.

To segment the display region, a closed contour between the screen frame and display region should be found first in our approach, in which a grayscale image containing the whole screen area is required. Because of some inherent characteristics embedded in a computer screen image, a mean-C adaptive thresholding algorithm is used to obtain a binarized image that contains the wanted closed-contour boundary. Then a parallel thinning algorithm is applied to reduce the thickness of the closed contour to be 1-pixel wide. Finally, our closed-contour tracking algorithm is used to perform the display region segmentation.

In the human-computer interaction of games, BCI is considered as one of the many possible input methods (together with keyboard, voice, gesture, etc.), which can be used to control games. However, so far, we have only seen simple BCI practice in games, almost all of which only use a single electroencephalography (EEG) signal, and only simple judgment is used as the form of human-computer interaction in the game. The reason may be that these games are still designed for traditional purposes, and BCI is also designed for medical purposes. Based on the background mentioned above, this paper proposes a specific BCI system designed for games, which realizes the brain-computer interaction between people and games through BCI technology.

Since the CS144 experimental framework has been shared on the Internet for several years, there are many reference codes on the Internet. In order to improve the effectiveness of the experiment, the teaching group specially designed two comprehensive experiments based on the CS144 experiment framework. The designed comprehensive experiment includes routing information protocol experiment and routing table search algorithm experiment. The comprehensive experimental framework requires students to use C++ language to realize the main functions of routing information protocol and routing table search algorithm, and a special testbed is designed to test the students' codes.

To achieve this criteria, we created a cloud-based virtual laboratory based on OpenStack cloud platform to facilitate access to virtual machine both locally and remotely. Cloud-based virtual labs bring a lot of advantages, such as increased manageability, scalability, high availability and flexibility, to name a few. This arrangement has been tested in a case-study exercise with a group of students as part of Computer Networks and System Administration courses at Kabul Polytechnic University in Afghanistan.

In this paper, a strategy-based framework is proposed for those who have limited resources of all kinds to introduce Data Science through their existing Computer Science programs at a baccalaureate level with a minimum curriculum disruption. Instead of a standalone program, to embed Data Science into Computer Science education is demonstrated to be a practical, effective, cost-saving approach based on an extensive study of the synergy between Data Science and Computer Science education. While the proposed framework is not a one-size-fits-all approach, it provides a doable route for blending Data Science into Computer Science education in systematic ways.

While providing high accuracies in classification, the subset selection techniques are associated with long training times due to the large feature set constructed from multichannel neural recordings. In this paper we study a novel denoising technique for reducing the dimensionality of the feature space which decreases the computational complexity of the subset selection step radically without causing any degradation in the final classification accuracy. The denoising procedure was based on the comparison of the energy in a particular time segment and in a given scale/level to the energy of the raw data. By setting denoising threshold a priori the algorithm removes those nodes which fail to capture the energy in the raw data in a given scale. We provide experimental studies towards the classification of motor imagery related multichannel ECoG recordings for a brain computer interface. The denoising procedure was able to reach the same classification accuracy without denoising and a computational complexity around 5 times smaller.

We can estimate an interaction surface of virtual touch screen between the display and the user which is scalable and flexible. The distance between the operator and the virtual touch screen can be changed and the operator can be varied. Users can use their pointing finger to interact with the display as if it was brought forward and presented directly in front of them, while preserving viewing angle.

The filtering process is being used to account for the fact that male employees might have different mustache and beard on their face on different days. So filtering is added to the picture to detect how he may look if they have mustache or beard. As a result, the risk of a faulty detection regardless of different facial appearance is minimized.

To overcome this, we propose an optimal segmentation method for identifying hand gestures from input images, improving recognition performance. For segmenting hand gestures, we compared the segmentation methods of YCbCr, SkinMask, and HSV (hue, saturation, and value). The CR component is extracted from YCbCr, then binarization, erosion, and hole filling are performed. Color segmentation is applied to the SkinMask process that detects pixels that match the color of the hand. In the HSV process, threshold masking determines the dominant features. The Softmax classification is used to classify hand gestures where features are extracted through convolutional neural network (CNN). The proposed segmentation methods are applied to a benchmark dataset and the result shows an improvement in recognition accuracy over state-of-the-art systems.","[human-computer interaction, segmentation, convolutional neural network, hand gesture]","[Image segmentation, Image color analysis, Feature extraction, Training, Gesture recognition, Human computer interaction, Technological innovation]","[feature extraction, gesture recognition, human computer interaction, image classification, image colour analysis, image segmentation, neural nets]",18-Jan-21,IEEE

This paper presents a breakthrough to make it easier for drivers to find an empty parking space with builds a car parking monitoring and management system based on computer vision. The system input is a camera that is installed in the center of the parking area. The HAAR Cascade Classifier method detects and counts the cars that are parked and then compared with the available parking slots using. If the number of cars currently parked is less than the slots provided, the parking area will inform you that it is still empty along with the number of available slots. Detection of available parking spaces is based on coordinates that have been determined manually on the camera. A total of five slot areas are determined by this camera.

The proposed system has been installed and tested in production condition, working with real lots of olives brought to the mill for the famer. Two full setups have been installed in the factory: before and after the olive washing process. The proposed methodology uses a feature vector of the samples that concatenates the olive image histograms from different colour spaces and the result values of two algorithms used to determine the texture (image entropy and grey level co-occurrence matrix). As classifier, an artificial neural network (ANN) was used. For the experimental validation, 6325 images from 100 batches were analysed showing good classification results (success ratios of 97.1% before the washing stage and 96.4% after).","[on-line olives classification, computer vision, olive oil extraction process, olive cleaning process]","[Image color analysis, Cleaning, Entropy, Histograms, Machine vision, Computer vision, Artificial neural networks]","[computer vision, entropy, image classification, image colour analysis, image texture, neural nets, production engineering computing, quality control, vegetable oils]",08-Oct-15,IEEE

In information technology and computer studies, computer programming is an extremely important foundation course for its corresponding professions. However, many studies on programming courses have pointed out that computer programming is a difficult subjectto learn,  even undergraduates in information technology and computer studies are deterred by it. According to past research, learners' maladaptive cognition and behavior when learning computer programming tend to affect learning achievement. The purpose of this study is to explore the effects of the maladaptive cognition and learners' behavior in computer programming courses on their learning achievement. Methods: For that reason, this study applied a research survey to investigate the relationship between learners' maladaptive cognition and behavior and learning achievement in computer programming courses. The research participants were students in the information management department of technical and vocational schools who had previously taken programming courses. A surface strategy scale and a procrastination scale were adopted as research instruments to measure learners' maladaptive cognition and behaviour, respectively. Results: The results showed that learners' maladaptive cognition in the learning processes of computer programming courses had a significant, positive impact on their maladaptive behaviour and a significant, negative impact on their learning achievement. These findings indicate that learners' maladaptive cognition affects learning processes and effectiveness. For that reason, learners should reduce the incidence of maladaptive cognition during learning activities, so as to effectively lessen its negative impact on learning outcomes. The results of this study could be used as a reference for educators and educational researchers when designing curricula in the field of computer programming.","[learning computer programming, surface strategy, procrastination, information technology and computer education]","[Cognition, Programming profession, Information technology, Education, Information management, Surface treatment]","[cognition, computer science education, educational courses, educational institutions, teaching]",13-Sep-18,IEEE

The dilemma that appears is how to develop the system thinking and particularly mathematical modelling in schools at earlier ages. In order to discuss dynamical systems, the basic knowledge of differential equations is necessary. Therefore, mathematical modelling appears to be applicable only to students. The article represents a possible processing of dynamical systems with graphic oriented computer programmes, e.g. Berkeley Madonna, Daynasys and Stella in primary schools. The programme packages enable the pupils to construct a given system by linking together different graphical objects for parameters, variables, and fluxes of variables.

Instead of submitting an assignment only once, students can use feedback to improve their work to increase their learning and grades. We describe our approach to mastery-based grading in introductory computer organization/architecture courses at two different institutions. Specifically, we allowed students to retake tests of basic skills as many times as needed, which was facilitated by programmatically-generated questions. For course projects, students were expected to refine and resubmit projects until they demonstrated mastery by passing all of the provided automated tests. We share our materials and experiences, including the challenge of loosening deadlines to provide students time for continued work without enabling them to fall irretrievably behind.CCS CONCEPTS• Applied computing $\rightarrow$ Interactive learning environments,  Computer-assisted instruction,  • Social and professional topics $\rightarrow$ Computer science education,  Student assessment,  • Computer systems organization $\rightarrow$ Architectures.

Therefore, Computer Vision (CV) and Deep Neural Network (DNN) are utilised to grade tomatoes by determining their maturity colour. Three hundred tomatoes were selected and its maturity level are assigned by expertise. The tomato images are captured, processed and passed to the DNN classifier to determine the tomato grade. The proposed DNN classifier achieved the mAP percentage of 95.52%. This shows that the computer vision built into the DNN algorithm can provide an efficient implementation for predicting tomato grade.","[tomato grading, computer vision, deep neural network]","[Deep learning, Computer vision, Image color analysis, Machine vision, Neural networks, Manuals, Prediction algorithms]","[agricultural products, computer vision, deep learning (artificial intelligence), food products, image classification, image colour analysis, product quality, production engineering computing]",13-Jun-22,IEEE

This study aimed to increase the classification accuracy of the MI through sequential transfer learning for a single dataset. EEG-MI data with 9 subjects from the dataset 2a of BCI competition IV were used. EEGNet was used for MI classification. The pre-trained model was constructed by first learning whether the data were MI or not. The model was then sequentially fine-tuned through transfer learning for four MI tasks (i.e., left hand, right hand, both feet and tongue). The model was able to classify MI with 91.34% accuracy. In the meantime, the baseline model without transfer learning showed an accuracy of 61.62%, whereas the fine-tuned model presented an improved accuracy of 63.82%.

A total of 211 students of a higher education institution in Mexico were asked information about their social and technological context, activities and preferences on concepts related to BCIs. Departing from the given information, we sketched a virtual environment which could be used to replace classic interaction paradigms in order to appeal to a better contextualization of the task required for motor imagery (MI) control. Later, the approach was validated with opinions of 62 students. Results point towards a favorable reception of the VE approach in contrast to the classic arrow paradigm.

Because the battery life is limited and the battery weight is an important factor for the size and the weight of the Pocket Companion, energy management plays a crucial role in the architecture. In our architecture we apply several supplementary power reduction techniques on all levels of the system, including the operating system and applications. The two main themes are: (1) to avoid wasteful activity, and (2) to exploit the locality of the reference.

The system's performance was tested using a movement-related BCI task in 3 able-bodied subjects with minimal previous BCI experience. Specifically, subjects were instructed to alternate between relaxing and dorsiflexing their right foot, while their EEG was acquired and analyzed in real-time by the BCI system to decode their underlying movement state. The EEG signals acquired by the custom amplifier array were similar to those acquired by a commercial amplifier (maximum correlation coefficient ρ=0.85). During real-time BCI operation, the average correlation between instructional cues and decoded BCI states across all subjects (ρ=0.70) was comparable to that of full-size BCI systems.

The application of computers to undergraduate teaching in electromagnetics in South African universities is discussed. One of the most basic problems students encounter is the inability to visualize fields spatially. In order to overcome this problem, students have to write their own programs to draw vector fields, as opposed to using existing packages. At a more advanced level, finite element, finite difference, and boundary-element methods are used to solve real problems starting with simple geometries such as capacitance problems, wires, bent wires, etc. Simple programs are used to calculate radiation patterns. In the more advanced elective undergraduate courses, use of popular commercial computer programs is common.

We analyze when and how to use interval arithmetic as an alternative to the methods used in POV-Ray for ray intersection. Interval methods are applied as robust approaches for solving the ray-surface intersection problem,  i.e. to find the minimal root in a set of analytic functions. POV-Ray is able to solve this problem efficiently for relatively simple objects (objects that can be bounded in a box). Interval based algorithms can speed up the rendering process for scenes with some infinite implicit surfaces, including nondifferentiable ones, where the automatic bounding box cannot be applied. Interval methods have the advantage of not needing to provide the interval guess of the maximum gradient, as recursive subdivision equipotential methods (used by POV-Ray) does. Experimental results were obtained from the evaluation of our interval algorithms and the methods used in POV-Ray in scenes with single objects and in complex scenes with several objects.",,"[Computer graphics, Digital arithmetic, TV, Layout, Ray tracing, Visualization, Computer architecture, Robustness, Production, Image generation]","[ray tracing, rendering (computer graphics), tree searching, data visualisation, surface fitting, Newton method, optimisation]",27-Oct-03,IEEE

This paper suggests a novel method for remote administration of computer and telecommunication networks. In this approach, (SMS) short massage service is used to inform administrators about a failure, as well as let them send commands for fixing the occurred failure. We set up an application program on one of the manageable network systems or on a system which has access to the internet, then using SNMP protocol,  we gather the needed information for the network administrator. Also network managers can send commands to the application software by Short Message Service to let it issue commands for fixing the failure.

Digital computer simulation of an electronic analog computer,K. O'Donnell,"Department of Aviation, Farmingdale State College, SUNY Farmingdale, New York","2018 IEEE Long Island Systems, Applications and Technology Conference (LISAT)",11-Jun-18,2018,"In recent years there has been renewed interest in analog computation to simulate dynamic physical systems. This paper sought to combine the accuracy and reliability of digital computers, with the benefits of parallel computing offered by electronic analog computers. One of the benefits of simulating an electronic analog computer is that a one-to-one correspondence has already been established between the building block components of an electronic analog computer and common operations used in differential equations. Historically, electronic analog computers were limited by physical components which needed constant calibration due to drift and loading effects. This study sought to determine whether a single-processor digital computer, using a serial program with procedures that replicate analog components, could simulate this parallel environment. We predicted that if the serial program proceeds in small time increments, with the value of all components updated during each increment, then this process would act as a parallel program. We also predicted that replacing physical components with digital procedures would eliminate the effects of drift and loading. The methodology used a computer program that graphically and procedurally replicates the electronic components and layout of an electronic analog computer. The results were compared against differential equations for the physical system, since physical electronic analog computers are not readily available. Findings indicate that with an increment of 0.01 second or smaller, the digital program accurately and smoothly simulates a dynamic physical system by solving the descriptive differential equation(s) in a parallel, analog fashion, without the need for digital component calibration.","[analog computation, analog computer, feedback, human-computer interaction, operational amplifier]","[Analog computers, Operational amplifiers, Differential equations, Computational modeling, Mathematical model, Resistors]","[analogue computers, calibration, differential equations, parallel programming]",11-Jun-18,IEEE

This can be a potential information security threat as the sensitive information can be stolen from a distance without leaving any trace. The video leakage signals contain the information of the image displayed in the computer, so the video leakage signals can be seen as special image signals. However, different from the normal image signal, the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of video leakage signal is low due to the environmental noise and many other man-made noises. In this paper, a novel wavelet based independent component analysis (ICA) method is proposed for improving SNR of computer video leakage signals. By using this method, we can improve the performance of pre-processing of computer video leaking signals. We solve the problem of using Fast ICA in processing video leakage signal by using a wavelet filter. The performance of Fast ICA is improved by working in wavelet domain because of advantages like ease of implementation and less computation time when compared to time domain. We pre-process one-dimensional received signal without reconstructing the image since it is inefficient to reconstruct signal before processing. A direct SNR can't be defined. Therefore, another metric called quasi signal to noise ratio (QSNR) is defined to estimate signal to noise ratio of video leakage signals. The processed results of the actual experimental data show that the proposed wavelet based ICA algorithm has a better performance than the Fast ICA algorithm and the Wavelet denoising algorithm.","[information security, image processing, signal pre-processing, noise reduction, independent component analysis, wavelet transform]","[Signal to noise ratio, Computers, Image reconstruction, Discrete wavelet transforms, Filtering algorithms, Time-domain analysis, Continuous wavelet transforms]","[computer displays, image denoising, image filtering, independent component analysis, noise (working environment), security of data, video signal processing, wavelet transforms]",18-Aug-16,IEEE

In this article, the comparison of conventional manual operation and digital manufacture using both RP and CNC machining technologies for denture production was presented. In addition, a digital custom denture manufacturing protocol integrating proposed computer abrasive teeth profile scanning, computer-aided denture design, 3D touchable force feedback feature modification and advanced denture manufacturing techniques were suggested. These proposed methods provide a solid evidence that digital design and manufacturing technologies may become a new avenue for custom-made denture design, analysis, and production in 21st century.","[custom denture design, CNC machining, rapid prototyping, abrasive computer tomography]","[Fabrication, Abrasives, Tomography, Prototypes, Computer aided manufacturing, Dentistry, Computer numerical control, Machining, Force feedback, Production]","[computerised tomography, machining, prosthetics, dentistry, computerised numerical control, rapid prototyping (industrial), image reconstruction, force feedback, human computer interaction]",10-Jan-06,IEEE

One of the most used and recommended tools to objectively measure upper limb dexterity is the Box and Block Test (BBT). However, the test itself is time consuming and very cumbersome.After briefly presenting a literature review, this paper proposes a computer vision (CV-BBT) approach to the traditional BBT, as a virtual alternative of the real world procedure. Our CV-BBT integrates all the original BBT’s guidelines and procedures into an interactive computer vision experience that utilizes bleeding edge technologies such as MediaPipe Hands for hand and finger tracking. This innovative tool require neither any additional computer peripherals (smart gloves, VR headsets) nor any kind of extra physical equipment (wooden box, blocks), but works instead with just a mid-range PC and a camera. Our system can be deployed in residential spaces and the test results can be sent remotely to any physician or rehabilitation expert. The application implementation is also demonstrated and conferred in-depth.Finally, we shortly discuss some technical issues of our computer vision approach, essentially being the hand’s pose prediction accuracy and processing times, as well as present some future directions regarding our tool’s score normalization of healthy patients against those achieved with the original BBT.","[Box & Block Test, Computer Vision, Rehabilitation Assessment, Upper-limb Rehabilitation, Telemedicine]","[Headphones, Computer vision, Computer peripherals, Medical services, Manuals, Kinematics, Telecommunications]","[biomechanics, computer vision, dexterous manipulators, medical robotics, patient rehabilitation, virtual reality]",14-Dec-22,IEEE

Shared-computer is increasingly used to support web collaborative explorative activities because learners can be facilitated to promote shared understanding of the workspace and enhance effective communications. However, implementing shared-computer can also be inefficient and frustrating because learners have to spend extra time and cognitive resources to negotiate with the web search. This may discourage learners to positively participate the activity. Hence, the study proposes a the 1:1 group (shared-computer integrated one person for one computer) so that learners can individually search web information with their personal laptop according to their strategies and preferences, and then use shared-computer to share their information and interact with peers. An empirical study involved nine graduate students is conducted to examine the learner's interaction behaviors in two scenarios: 1:1 and shared-computer. The result shows that the 1:1 group can better benefit participants' in-depth interaction due to the autonomy of personal web search strategy and preference.","[web collaborative exploration learning, one-to-one, shared-computer, pattern of interaction]","[Collaborative work, Collaborative software, Web search, Presses, Portable computers]","[computer aided instruction, groupware, information retrieval, Internet]",18-Aug-11,IEEE

Proceedings.",22-Nov-04,2004,"The benefits of constructionism as a learning paradigm are widely recognised. Though the constructionist philosophy can be seen as applying to activities that are not necessarily computer-based (such as bricolage and concept mapping), its modern application in educational technology has been closely linked with computer use. In particular, Papert's work on LOGO programming in schools has both informed the original concept of constructionism and been a major influence over subsequent computer-based constructionist developments. This paper questions whether - despite these precedents - traditional computer programming is well-suited for the constructionist educational agenda. It argues that other approaches to computer model-building, such as those based on spreadsheet principles, are in fact much better aligned to the objectives of constructionism. Building on this basis, it proposes that more effective computer support for the constructionist perspective is offered by empirical modelling (EM) within a conceptual experiential framework for learning (the EFL).",,"[Buildings, Application software, Programming profession, Computer science, Educational technology, Educational institutions, History, Computer aided instruction, Human factors, Concrete]","[computer aided instruction, educational technology, programming, computer science education]",22-Nov-04,IEEE

Results suggest that academic performance satisfaction plays an important role in students' persistence in general. Also, studying with peers may increase women's intention to persist in CS. However, academic support has a negative association with ethnic minorities' persistence in the major. These findings can be used to make decisions to improve students' retention in CS.

Due to the global pandemic and resulting lock-downs, the course was held online, hence, we also analyze the effects of the current situation on the students.The results revealed that the structure of the course is appreciated by the students. Furthermore, the students liked the open source software taught in the course where they can create visual workflows with an intuitive, drag-and-drop style graphical interface, without the need for coding. The results also confirmed our hypothesis which showed that working in groups is more complex and difficult using online tools. We learn that the instructor-generated technique for forming the groups assigning to each group students with different backgrounds, lead to teams that are able to solve problems faster as they are more cognitively diverse.

The main purpose of this paper is to reconsider how the zero-calibration problem of BCI for a realistic situation can be overcome from the perspective of DG tasks. In terms of the realistic situation, we have focused on creating an EEG classification framework that can be applied directly in unseen sessions, using only multi-subject/-session data acquired previously. Therefore, in this paper, we tested four deep learning models and four DG algorithms through leave-one-session-out validation. Our experiment showed that deeper and larger models were effective in cross-session generalization performance. Furthermore, we found that none of the explicit DG algorithms outperformed empirical risk minimization. Finally, by comparing the results of fine-tuning using subject-specific data, we found that subject-specific data may deteriorate unseen session classification performance due to inter-session variability.","[Brain-computer interface, deep learning, electroen-cephalography, motor imagery, domain generalization]","[Deep learning, Brain modeling, Brain-computer interfaces, Electroencephalography, Classification algorithms, Risk management, Task analysis]","[brain-computer interfaces, calibration, cognition, electroencephalography, learning (artificial intelligence), medical signal processing, pattern classification, signal classification]",05-Apr-21,IEEE

A BCI is expected to classify day-to-day life activities like grabbing and lifting a glass of water. Currently, motor imagery based BCI for two closely separated muscle groups like grabbing and lifting an object has not been studied. Challenge of classifying motor imagery of these activities accurately could be solved by using individual BCI. We proposed to achieve the same by using a neural network (machine learning) classifier on high resolution (129 channel) EEG data evaluated continuously every 80ms after spatial filtering using spherical Laplacian. This study employed a motor imagery based BCI optimized for individual subjects (n=28) using EEG data of actual movement for classifying motor imagery of grab, lift and grab+lift of right forearm. A three layered neural network with two output nodes was created for classifying the motor imagery using power of 8-14 Hz band of 500 ms EEG data. This BCI was able to classify motor imagery with 95.65% accuracy. In continuous evaluation, BCI showed a True Positive Rate of 24.89% and False Positive Rate of 12.93%. The percentage of correctly classified motor imagery in each trial was 84.99%, 72.23%, 17.07% for grab, lift and combined respectively.

The methodology implementation comprises capturing an image of a metric staff using a digital camera, then the height is computed by processing the image using a developed algorithm. The algorithm consists of two major steps. In the first step, the implemented software computes the meter and tenth of meter height values through recognizing numbers in the image. Then, it computes the rest of the decimal part digits from the coordinate difference between the image's middle row (reading line) and E shape's (or its mirror image) end row. The proposed algorithm works well for the tested precisions (1, 0.1, and 0.01milimeters), also it can measure the heights from a distance up to more than 100m.

In general, the BCI system requires a calibration procedure to tune the model every time the system is used. This problem is recognized as a major obstacle to BCI, and to overcome it, approaches based on transfer learning (TL) have recently emerged. However, many BCI paradigms are limited in that they consist of a structure that shows labels first and then measures ""imagery"", the negative effects of source subjects containing data that do not contain control signals have been ignored in many cases of the subject-to-subject TL process. The main purpose of this paper is to propose a method of excluding subjects that are expected to have a negative impact on subject-to-subject TL training, which generally uses data from as many subjects as possible. In this paper, we proposed a BCI framework using only high-confidence subjects for TL training. In our framework, a deep neural network selects useful subjects for the TL process and excludes noisy subjects, using a co-teaching algorithm based on the small-loss trick. We experimented with leave-one-subject-out validation on two public datasets (2020 international BCI competition track 4 and OpenBMI dataset).

Adaptive genetic algorithms (AGAs) have been built for inducing exploitation/exploration relationships that improve the final results. One of the most widely studied adaptive approaches are the adaptive parameter setting techniques. Nevertheless, there are no standard rules for choosing appropriate values for these parameters and this decision is usually taken in terms of the most common values or experimental formulas given in literature, or by means of trial an error methods. The paper presents an effective approach based on a meta-level GA combined with an adaptation strategy of the GA control parameters to find and adjust the optimum probabilities to improve the GA performance.

Human motion capture for animation and VR has reached a level of capturing real motion data from people using various visual and non-visual sensors. However, most of the available systems require special devices and environment, or even attach extra things onto an actor. To realize a personal system, this paper developed a general software to acquire arbitrary motion from a video sequence. A general 3D articulate human model with changeable size, color and surface shape is prepared. This model is then driven either automatically or manually to match with the moving body in the consecutive image frames. This matching starts from key frames that contain key poses. A specific orientation interpolation is used to get the motion status in in-between frames and finally a smooth motion is obtained. This approach is suitable for personal use to meet wide needs of human motion acquisition.","[Video Sequences, Human motion capture, Chinese Kung-fu, Computer Games, Key Frames]","[Interpolation, Solid modeling, Video sequences, Biological system modeling, Quaternions, Computers, Three-dimensional displays]","[computer games, image motion analysis, image sequences, solid modelling, video signal processing]",19-Jun-14,IEEE

Using a commercial camera reduces the cost of the product, while enabling the testing of new detection algorithms. A simulation setup is helpful in this context. The computer vision based spectroscopy simulation, which we propose here, involves displaying patterns on a computer screen corresponding to a reduced standard database of spectra, observing the screen using a camera, and detecting the elements, preferably on a different computer. We show that, using markers and computing homographies, correct alignment of the scene and image planes can be achieved to detect the element.

While previous study focused on examining the design pattern of SBL tools, few have investigated students' perception toward the SBL tools. To advance the understanding of the simulation-based learning process, this study adopted Packet Tracker (PT), a SBL tool introduced by Cisco Inc., in the course - “Introductory Course of Information Technology” of a university in northern Taiwan. A research framework was proposed to discuss relationship between system interactivity, perception toward PT, learning outcome and intention. Research results show the interactivity of SBL tools could be a key feature that developers need to be considered when developing. Moreover, students' perceptions of usefulness and educational value have divergent effects on self-evaluation and intention to use.

Modern examples include address-lookup in network routers for a forwarding outgoing link, rule-matching in intrusion detection systems comparing incoming packets with a large database, etc. Hashing algorithms involve transforming a key inside each target data to a hash value hoping that the hashing would render the database a uniform distribution with respect to this new hash value. When the database are already key-wise uniformly distributed, any regular hashing algorithm would easily lead to perfectly uniform distribution after the hashing. On the other hand, if records in the database are instead not uniformly distributed, then different hashing functions would lead to different performance. This paper addresses the case when such distribution follows a natural negative linear distribution, which is found to approximate distributions in many various applications. For this distribution, we derive a general formula for calculating the distribution variance produced by any given non-overlapped bit-grouping XOR hashing function. Such a distribution variance from the hashing directly translates to performance variations in searching. In this paper, the best XOR hashing function is determined for any given key size and any given hashing target size.","[address lookup, computer networks, hashing, internet, intrusion detection, network security, packet matching]","[Computer networks, Distributed databases, Intrusion detection, Information retrieval, Permission, Information systems, Secure storage, Algorithm design and analysis, IP networks, Computer security]","[computer networks, file organisation, information retrieval, statistical distributions]",17-Nov-08,IEEE

They are extensively used in Computer Vision. They are complicated but very effective in extracting features from an image or a video stream. After AlexNet [5] won the ILSVRC [8] in 2012, there was a drastic increase in research related with CNNs. Many state-of-the-art architectures like VGG Net [12], GoogleNet [13], ResNet [18], Inception-v4 [14], Inception-Resnet-v2 [14], ShuffleNet [23], Xception [24], MobileNet [6], MobileNetV2 [7], SqueezeNet [16], SqueezeNext [17] and many more were introduced. The trend behind the research depicts an increase in the number of layers of CNN to make them more efficient but with that the size of the model increased as well. This problem was fixed with the advent of new algorithms which resulted in a decrease in model size. As a result, today we have CNN models which are implemented on mobile devices. These mobile models are small and fast which in turn reduce the computational cost of the embedded system.

Today's computer-interactive voices (Alexa and Google Assistant) are largely repetitive, robot-like, and all-knowing, sometimes making them tiring and monotonous. The challenge is to better simulate the human voice and personality, with a face generating the voice. Covid and sprawling cities are making people increasingly isolated. A game or program on TV can be better enjoyed when accompanied by a computer companion. Other than companionship for entertainment, there can be companionship for therapy, such as at a hospital or at an old-age home. Personalities of famous people such as scientists, statesmen, actors, and sportsmen can be recreated. The computer voice can be a training ground for social etiquette for children and adults. A simulated baby voice can be used for training would-be parents. A simulated patient's voice can be used for training doctors and nurses. With videoconferencing being the new norm in these times of Covid, the simulated voice and video will appear more real than before. The bonding of humans with the computer voice raises ethical questions about whether this could become addictive, and whether details of the interaction can be used by the company and the government. Ominously, can the simulated voice of a child become the face of the government, using the data to profile or even arrest users? Could the government use the voice to inspire users to be hard working, law abiding, and tax-paying citizens?

Mayda","Bilgisayar Mühendisliği Bölümü, İstanbul Esenyurt Üniversitesi, İstanbul, Türkiye,  Bilgisayar Mühendisliği Bölümü, İstanbul Esenyurt Üniversitesi, İstanbul, Türkiye",2020 4th International Symposium on Multidisciplinary Studies and Innovative Technologies (ISMSIT),17-Nov-20,2020,"Today, gaining computer programming skills and understanding the logic of algorithm has become important not only for those working in this field but also for those working in almost every profession. However, various difficulties are encountered in programming education for many reasons. In order for students to overcome these difficulties, they have to solve many sample programming questions. Although there are some English-based resources on exercise questions for those trying to learn programming, there is not yet a comprehensive and sufficient resource for Turkish. In order to fulfill this need, a web-based algorithm exercise and assessment management system with Turkish content was developed in this study. In the system called AlgoBug, users solve the practice questions of many programming languages in order from easy to difficult. Users' solutions are assessed by other users in the role of evaluator who are more advanced in that programming language, and detailed feedback is given to them. In addition to written feedback, solutions are scored between 1 and 10 points, and solutions scoring 7 or more are considered “correct”. In order to carry out tasks such as introducing the system to new users in the system and guiding them in the programming learning process, the former users who have completed all the questions in a programming language are also given a consultancy role. With the AlgoBug system, people who are new to programming are provided with the opportunity to practice abundantly on the topics they have learned, while helping them to understand and correct their mistakes and shortcomings with the detailed feedback they receive on their solutions. While the users continue to improve themselves by solving the questions in a programming language, on the other hand, evaluating the solutions of the lower level users in the evaluator role enables them to further consolidate what they have learned with the “learning by teaching” approach. It is thought that the AlgoBug system will contribute to reducing the difficulties encountered in programming education.","[computer programming, programming education, exercise and assessment management system]","[Computer languages, Education, Task analysis, Programming profession]","[computer aided instruction, computer science education, Internet, program debugging, programming languages, teaching]",17-Nov-20,IEEE
Position Statement: On the Evolution of Adversary Models in Computer Systems and Networks,V. D. Gligor,"Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA",2008 32nd Annual IEEE International Computer Software and Applications Conference,08-Aug-08,2008,"Summary form only given. Invariably, new technologies introduce new vulnerabilities which often enable new attacks by increasingly potent adversaries. Yet new systems are more adept at handling well-known attacks by old adversaries than anticipating new ones. Our adversary models seem to be perpetually out of date: often they do not capture adversary attacks and sometimes they address attacks rendered impractical by new technologies. In this panel presentation, I provide a brief overview of adversary models beginning with those required by program and data sharing technologies ('60-70s), continuing with those required by computer communication and networking technologies (70s-'90s), and ending with those required by and sensor network technologies ('00s ->). I argue that sensor, ad-hoc, and mesh networks require new models, that are able to account for physical node capture by adversaries. Protecting device secrets (e.g., cryptographic keys) via physical security mechanisms will continue to require network security measures, despite advances in physical security measures and devices. I argue that ""good-enough"" measures in the face of node capture by adversaries can be obtained by using emergent properties. Intuitively, these are properties that cannot be provided by individual network nodes - no matter how well-endowed nodes might be - but instead result from interaction and collaboration among multiple nodes. Such properties can be used to detect, often probabilistically, the presence of an adversary within a network and to pinpoint with reasonable accuracy the affected network area (e.g., identify a specific captured node, a particular properly of captured nodes). However, all such measures require periodic network monitoring in normal mode to detect a somewhat rare event (i.e., node capture, replica insertion) and hence their cost can be high. I illustrate a new simple probabilistic protocol that avoids the effects of node capture by detecting adversaries attempts to access a node's internal state, and discuss various design trade-offs that will characterize much of the future research in this area.",,"[Computational modeling, Computers, Security, Probabilistic logic, Conferences, Monitoring, Atmospheric measurements]","[computer networks, telecommunication security]",08-Aug-08,IEEE

The effectiveness of vaccinations on the spread of email-borne computer viruses,"S. Data,  Hui Wang","York University, Toronto, ON, CA,  Department of Computer Science and Engineering, York University, Toronto, ON, Canada","Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering, 2005.",03-Jan-06,2005,"In the last decade, computer viruses have caused tremendous losses to organizations. New viruses continue to cause havoc, in spite of having better antivirus software. It is thus imperative that we understand what factors significantly influence the spread of viruses. In this paper, we model the networks of users as graphs. For simplicity, we assume that every user works only on their own computer. We assume that nodes in the graph are initially susceptible to infection. Once infected, a node may spread the virus (using perhaps, the inbox or address book) until either the virus is removed and the node is immunized. We assume that an immunized node never gets the same virus again. We study the effect of vaccinations in containing the spread of email-borne computer viruses on some traditional structured interconnection graphs, as well as ""Internet-like"" small-world graphs. We test the effectiveness of vaccinations in containing the spread of viruses by looking at the total number of nodes infected for different values of the delay D which is incurred in detecting a virus, developing a vaccine and immunizing each infected node. Our simple user model assumes that a user is likely to open an email attachment (and activate the virus) with probability p and delete it with probability 1 - p. Intuitively, one would expect that the fraction of nodes infected would increase slowly as p is varied or as D is varied. Using simulations, we demonstrate that while this is true for the traditional graphs we used, it does not hold for small-world graphs. Since user networks are known to be small-world graphs, this implies that vaccinations are far less effective on real networks than they would be if the user networks were like traditional interconnection graphs",,"[Computer viruses, Internet, Immune system, Computer science, Testing, Delay effects, Vaccines]","[computer viruses, electronic mail, graph theory, Internet]",03-Jan-06,IEEE

Each link has a cost representing the desirability of using that particular link. The shortest path then becomes the path in which the total link cost from a source node to a destination node is minimized. While there are many conventional algorithms available, non of them are without drawbacks. In order to find a better solution, the use of Hopfield neural network as a routing algorithm is explored in this paper. This approach is based on a solution proposed for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The routing problem is considerably similar to the TSP problem in that it is concerned with finding an optimal route which connects a source node with a destination node. The neural network architecture is implemented and tested, and a comparison between the neural solution and the conventional routing algorithms is also presented. The neural network gives approximately 97.3% of optimum routes, this represents a significant improvement over other neural network approaches already implemented.",,"[Application software, Hopfield neural networks, Routing, Computer networks, Neural networks, Costs, Packet switching, Communication switching, Traveling salesman problems, Testing]","[telecommunication network routing, Hopfield neural nets, travelling salesman problems, computer networks]",06-Aug-02,IEEE

What we propose is to use 3D computer simulations in such a versatile way that those simulations could act as learning objects designed directly by those who own the experience we want to be transmitted. In order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to create a model in charge of communicating learning objects and simulators. This model ensures that, on the one hand, the simulation offers an interface to the learning process stable enough not to be affected by every small change. On the other hand, the model also ensures that the simulation offers a mechanism for adopting changes in the learning process. The key to solve this contradiction is to take the complex behavior of the simulation objects out of their control, leaving in them just very basic behaviors.

A critical barrier in providing computer science learning opportunities to all is the dearth of professionals who have the expertise to teach computer science. Blended learning approaches have the potential to reduce this barrier by facilitating the distribution of expertise across distances. In this poster we present our approach to understanding how to design blended learning models for the informal space that take advantage of the expertise of adult mentors and computer science experts. Our theoretical framing is based on Nacu et al. (2014) adult mentor roles, which suggest that adults play different roles (e.g., encourager, monitor, broker) to support students learning. We use Minecraft, a popular, 3D, online, multiplayer game, as our study context. The poster presents two studies that investigate ways of facilitating mentorship in a blended learning environment to teach computational thinking. Study 1 focuses on documenting the roles mentors play while facilitating a computer science-related Minecraft workshop with middle school students. Study 2 focuses on understanding how these roles are modified when online and in person mentors work together to facilitate a computational learning opportunity. Our initial findings suggest that defining a scalable model to support blended learning models in informal spaces requires a variety of mentor roles. Additionally, when coordinating mentorship across mediums, gaps in student support can arise when there is a lack of (a) explicit strategies of communication in place between in-person and online mentors,  and (b) clearly defined roles assigned to mentors.",,"[Computer science, Computational modeling, Media, Electronic mail, Monitoring, Three-dimensional displays, Games]","[computer aided instruction, computer games, computer science education, teaching]",02-Feb-17,IEEE

Early user interfaces were extremely limited because of the computers limited resources. As computing systems and computing power evolve, so have the user interfaces evolved. The current stage of evolution for graphical user interfaces (GUI) for most computer systems is the WIMP (Windows, Icons, Mice, Pointer). The WIMP graphical user interface design has been the standard since its conception in the 1970s. Progressing beyond the WIMP to the next level of graphical user interface has proven extremely difficult [1]. Animated Graphical User Interfaces (AGUI) are a significant improvement over windowed interfaces for some applications. The users perceived usefulness, perceived value, and perceived quality can be improved by applying an Animated Graphical User Interface to the application. Improving the users perceived usefulness, perceived value, and perceived quality can lead to a significant increase in revenue for some applications. Advertising in traditional windowed applications is not widely accepted by users making it difficult to use as a revenue source. The introduction of an Animated Graphical User Interface to an application also gives rise to the option of introducing animated advertising in the application. Animated advertising can present a new revenue source in addition to or in place of the purchase price of the application. Animated advertisements can be presented in an entertaining and passive format that users will find acceptable in applications where advertising is not normally tolerated. The Animated Graphical User Interface can also be used to bridge language barriers. Animations for the interface can be designed with a goal of language independence.

ARMs for the poor: Selecting a processor for teaching computer architecture,A. Clements,"University of Teesside, UK",2010 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE),23-Dec-10,2010,"Teachers of computer architecture and organization courses have to choose a target processor to illustrate the basic principles of instruction set design. In this paper we suggest that it is time to choose the ARM processor architecture that is markedly different to those used in most current courses. A specific computer architecture is required as a vehicle to teach about registers, addressing modes, instruction types, and so on. Resorting to a hypothetical teaching machine reduces the student's learning burden and makes their learning curve shallow, but failing to introduce them to the complexities they will encounter in the real world can destroy their motivation. Teachers are concerned not only with covering a body of knowledge,  they must motivate students and create a sense of excitement. In a discipline as rapidly changing as computer science, only those students who can adapt to change are likely to thrive over the four or more decades of their career. This paper explains why the ARM architecture is an excellent vehicle for teaching computer architecture,  in particular, its predicated execution, inclusion of shifting in all data-processing instructions, and its compressed code (Thumb) mode. Moreover, the ARM has a RISC architecture with some traditional CISC architectural features.","[Computer architecture education, microprocessor instruction sets, selecting a microprocessor]","[Computer architecture, Registers, Computers, Reduced instruction set computing, Microprocessors, Thumb, Education]","[computer aided instruction, computer science education, microprocessor chips, reduced instruction set computing]",23-Dec-10,IEEE

In a testing of 8 subjects' EEG data from the active auditory BCI experiment, the proposed adaptive approach needs only about 4-6 trials to reach the equivalent accuracy of 15-trial averaging.

Specifically, the hybrid BCI includes an asynchronous brain switch based on SSVEP and P300, and a P300-based BCI. The brain switch is used to turn on/off the control system of the electric nursing bed through idle/control state detection, whereas the P300-based BCI is for operating the nursing bed. At the beginning, the user may focus on one group of flashing buttons in the graphic user interface (GUI) of the brain switch, which can simultaneously evoke SSVEP and P300, to switch on the control system. Here, the combination of SSVEP and P300 is used for improving the performance of the brain switch. Next, the user can control the nursing bed using the P300-based BCI. The GUI of the P300-based BCI includes 10 flashing buttons, which correspond to 10 functional operations, namely, left-side up, left-side down, back up, back down, bedpan open, bedpan close, legs up, legs down, right-side up, and right-side down. For instance, he/she can focus on the flashing button “back up” in the GUI of the P300-based BCI to activate the corresponding control such that the nursing bed is adjusted up.

SHEF depends on the board position features to large extent, but it hardly includes all the features due to the limit of knowledge of the designer. And, SLEF can explore the knowledge hidden in the current position which is difficult to find in SHEF. In this paper, a hybrid position evaluation function (HPEF) is designed by fusing SHEF and SLEF. The temporal difference learning (TDL) is used to train the proposed HPEF on professional game records. Based on HPEF, a CCCG player called CCCGp is developed. We experimentally validate that HPEF is quite effective by competing with different kinds of testing players. With the help of HPEF, the intelligent level of CCCGp can be improved incrementally with the increase of number of professional game records HPEF learned.","[Chinese-chess computer game, evaluation function, neural network, professional game records, temporal difference learning]",[Testing],"[computer games, learning (artificial intelligence)]",16-Aug-12,IEEE

Engineering Education for the 21st Century,06-Aug-02,1995,"As a discipline, computer science has seen many dramatic changes. The content of the curriculum has for the most part kept pace with these changes. However the pedagogy has changed very little. Most computer science instruction uses the lecture method as the exclusive means of teaching the fundamentals of the material and out-of-class programming assignments to ensure appropriate programming skills are developed. In most cases, students learn to write short programs from scratch, by themselves. Compare this with the real world where programs are thousands or millions of lines long, are often extensively modified and maintained rather than merely constructed, are manipulated in a tool-rich environment, where work is almost always a team effort, and where the form of a solution has profound impact on future cost and performance. This clearly illustrates the problem. There is a serious mismatch between what is taught, how it is taught, and the emphasis it receives on one hand and what the consumers of the education actually need on the other.

The spiral technology features a simple internal self-routing algorithm that adapts quickly and automatically to failed nodes or links. The six most important direct consequences of the network architecture are the topology's: (1) ease of expansion,  (2) fast, on-the-fly self-routing,  (3) extremely high tolerance to network faults,  (4) increased network security,  (5) potential for the total elimination of store-and-forward transmissions due to routing decision delays,  and (6) rendering the maximum path length issue moot.<>",,"[Computer networks, Network topology, Spirals, Routing, Computer architecture, Optical fiber LAN, High speed optical techniques, Optical fibers, Costs, Optical fiber networks]",[computer networks],06-Aug-02,IEEE

An object or a grouping of objects is mapped as a point or a set of points in a multidimensional space and the coordinates in that space. In this system, new concepts can be input in a conversational manner that is based on combinations of previously defined concepts. These concepts are then reevaluated and can be subsequently used to form higher-level concepts at the operator's discretion. New object concepts exist as hierarchical structures of points in a multidimensional feature space, based on more primitive objects. The concept-space model is a quantitative medium for the representation of visual and verbal concepts and is compatible with accepted qualitative linguistic theories.

The digital quantum computer that can be implemented in FPGA is described in the article. Digital quantum coprocessor is designed to implement algorithms for execution on analog quantum computers. A digital quantum coprocessor operates under the control of a classical computer and together they are digital quantum computer. The digital quantum coprocessor is a set of digital units called digital qubits that have multibit data input and one bit data output each. The digital qubit is a wave function calculator. There is pseudo random number generator (PRNG) in described digital qubit to generate the probabilistic output bit. One bit qubit output qb is formed by the probable reduction of its multibit result x to one bit (0 or 1) according to result value x and pseudo random code k (x is an angle which determines the position of normalized vector with length 1 in polar grid, it is a result of multibit input data calculation).

At such tiny scales, switching times are likely to be in femtoseconds, i.e. quadrillionths of a second (Walls, 1994). Since electrical signals travel about 30 cm (a foot) in a nanosecond, a femtosecond will correspond to a millionth of this distance, i.e. a length of about 300 molecules. Traditional computing methodologies, using a centralized memory to store program instructions, and a centralized ALU to perform calculations, will no longer be appropriate, due to the time delays involved in fetching instructions from the program memory to the ALU. In the time this would take, the ALU would have changed its state (switching in femtoseconds). Hence both the program instructions and the means used to execute them, need to be distributed throughout the 3D space of the computational medium, whatever form it takes.

Teachers provide online materials to students for preparation of the lecture and students dedicate to practice in the course. We have put into practice the flipped classroom in our computer programming courses teaching C and Java languages since 2013 as a way of utilizing our e-learning system and contents. As a problem in computer programming education, although teachers explain grammar, students cannot create software well by themselves and. Some students give up the learning. Our goal is to promote each student's learning motivation and understanding for computer programming by the training that the flipped classroom and collaborative learning are applied to. Main feature of this approach is to spend most of the time of a programming class with collaboration among students in order to make practical software. We assign the students homework using Flash animations and video data explaining the lecture as learning-materials to learn vocabularies and grammar of the programming languages every week. Web-based tests consisting of easy questions to confirm the results of doing homework every week are done at the beginning of the actual classes, and it is useful to clarify difficult parts of understanding that the students don't notice. Additionally, we confirmed the effectiveness of this approach by comparing examination scores between 2012 and 2014. Compared with the score of 2012, the average scores of the Web-based test and the written test on mid-exam became high, and the minimum scores of both of the tests also became high.

This way, there is a high demand for accountability regarding the measurement and analysis of enriched game based learning activities or game-based learning analytics (GBLA). This demand is especially highlighted in one of the most difficult areas of Computer Science, which is computer programming education.

We exploit the agent-oriented software paradigm with its characteristics that provide intelligent autonomous behavior together with a real time computer vision system to achieve high performance real time target tracking. The framework consists of four layers,  interface, strategic, management, and operation layers. Interface layer receives from the user the tracking parameters such as the number and type of trackers and targets and type of the tracking environment, and then delivers these parameters to the subsequent layers. Strategic (decision making) layer is provided with a knowledge base of target tracking methodologies that are previously implemented by researchers in diverse target tracking applications and are proven successful. And by inference in the knowledge base using the user input a tracking methodology is chosen. Management layer is responsible for pursuing and controlling the tracking methodology execution. Operation layer represents the phases in the tracking methodology and is responsible for communicating with the real-time computer vision system to execute the algorithms in the phases. The framework is presented with a case study to show its ability to tackle the target tracking problem and its flexibility to solve the problem with different tracking parameters.

Its popularity owes to the increasing relevance of vertical farms as a panacea for the effect of desertification and urbanization as proposed by experts and researchers. Urbanization is increasing annually, as at the middle of year 2020 according to statistica.com the rate of urbanization was at 56 percent, and it has been estimated that by the year 2050 about 70-90% of global population will live in cities. The tripod effect of urbanization, desertification and climate change has made vertical farms a convenient alternative. While vertical farm is helping to solve this problem, the interface of computers with vertical farms has exponentially increased the efficiency, it has helped to create convenient environments which can be controlled, as such facilitating and all-around production of food crops all through the year despite changing environmental conditions. In this paper, we are taking a step further to see how computer vision can help in this process. So far IoT has been used to monitor the farm extrinsic factors, and get relevant data, the problem with that method is that only the external factors are being monitored, in this paper we will be exploring how computer vision can monitor intrinsic factors, but beyond that, we will also explore how computer vision and machine learning methods could be used together with IoT for the control of vertical farms as well to create favorable conditions for the planting of vertical farms.","[Computer vision, vertical farm, machine learning]","[Climate change, Computer vision, Tensors, Computational modeling, Urban areas, Sociology, Crops]","[computer vision, crops, farming, Internet of Things, learning (artificial intelligence)]",07-Feb-22,IEEE

This paper presents a novel self-paced BCI (SBCI) that extracts compact and relevant features from EEG using CS. To detect an intentional control (IC) state from user's EEG, the signal structure of a specific voluntary movement that is common in all trials is identified. This compressed subset of basis functions is constructed during the BCIs training mode and is then used to acquire features during its testing mode.

The mouse is an excellent invention in HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) technology. Though wireless or Bluetooth mouse technology is invented still, that technology is not completely device free. A Bluetooth mouse has the requirement of battery power and connecting dongle. Presence of extra devices in a mouse increases the difficulty to use it. The proposed mouse system is beyond this limitation. This paper proposes a virtual mouse system based on HCI using computer vision and hand gestures. Gestures captured with a built-in camera or webcam and processed with color segmentation & detection technique. The user will be allowed to control some of the computer cursor functions with their hands which bear colored caps on fingertips. Primarily, a user can perform left clicks, right clicks, and double clicks, scrolling up or down using their hand in different gestures. This system captures frames using a webcam or built-in cam and processes the frames to make them track-able and after that recognizes different gestures made by users and perform the mouse function. So the proposed mouse system eliminates device dependency in order to use a mouse. Therefore it can be proved beneficial in order to develop HCI technology.","[HCI (Human-Computer Interaction), HSV (Hue Saturation Value), Hand Gesture, Color Detection, Gesture Recognition]","[Mice, Color, Gesture recognition, Image color analysis, Human computer interaction, Webcams]","[Bluetooth, computer vision, gesture recognition, human computer interaction, image colour analysis, image segmentation, mouse controllers (computers)]",19-Dec-19,IEEE

A major problem that was mentioned many times in a regular semester evaluation, after integrating the EV3, is the fact that the students cannot use the robots outside of the laboratory. So they are not able to learn and program the EV3 independently from the laboratory opening hours and practical lessons. To solve this problem and improve the success with this platform, it will now be analysed if a simulation could advance the process of deepening the learned skills in practical and theoretical computer science lessons.

The objective of this study is to design a brain interface system that requires very few channels, has a zero false activation rate and a high true activation rate. To attain this objective, a brain-computer interface that is EEG-based and that is activated by mental tasks is proposed. The system is custom designed for each subject. For each subject, the most discriminatory mental task that yields a zero false activation rate is determined. By keeping the false positive rate at zero, the number of channels needed is reduced. We show that we can obtain a false positive rate of zero value and a true positive rate in the range of 71.96% to 77.61% with only three electrode channels. The dataset used was not collected in a self-paced paradigm,  however, it is employed to show that the design of a self-paced interface is feasible.

The steps of preprocessing include of transformation from color images to gray images, images filtering with mean filter or median filter, and binaryzation of the gray images. The edges of chessboard and chessman are able to be extracted from the binarized images by image segmentation. Then the location of center of chessman and the circle edge of chessman can be calculated with an advanced Hough transformation, which can ascertain the location of chessman in the chessboard and the size of each chessman. According to the features of chess images, main recognition method is to analyze the radial chess pixel statistical data with mathematical morphology.

However, while students learn new content, there is mostly no live person to provide feedback, especially in a virtual environment. Therefore, there are many software for automated code reviews to provide feedback to programming language learners. However, there are no available auto command review tools for security tools except for each tool itself and operating system suggestions. There is also no feedback tool that constructively provides feedback according to learners’ experiences in security subjects while learners practice with commands. Therefore, we developed an automatic feedback system that uses machine learning to create customized student feedback on cybersecurity topics. The foundation of the software was completed and tested in 2 undergraduate introductory computer science courses. Survey results collected from users indicate that the automatic feedback system improved the learning experience of 46% of successful participants and that 77% of successful participants were interested in the continued development of the system. 88% of successful participants felt that the system taught basic command-line skills effectively.","[education, educational technology, computer-aided instruction, electronic learning, computer science education, artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer security]","[Computer science, Computer languages, Codes, Operating systems, Education, Virtual environments, Machine learning]","[computer aided instruction, computer based training, computer crime, computer science education, educational courses, learning (artificial intelligence), security of data, teaching]",11-Oct-22,IEEE

First, we have programmed and calibrated a PVFS simulator,  using this simulator, we demonstrated that PVFS has a very good scalability where the number of nodes in the cluster is smaller than a given threshold. This threshold actually corresponds to the saturation of the network bandwidth. To go beyond this limit, we propose to use wide striping and replication in the same file system. We also propose a new data distribution technique based upon ""chained declustering"", that warranties high availability and scalability. This also allow's the system to be improved with minimal cost, without service interruption and with a minimal degradation of service. In addition, the granularity of the file system is ideal: the size of the cluster can be adjusted to the needed performances with a precision of one node. Finally, we propose a complete architecture, using cluster of clusters, where the performances are not limited by the network performances. In order to validate our file system, we use the PVFS simulator where the improvements have been implemented. The results show that the performances of the system are close to the ideal case. Once the size of the origin cluster is well defined, the total number of nodes in the system is not limited any more, and the performances increase linearly.

SKP-based SLSD focus on the syntactic knowledge called Syntax Knowledge Point(SKP) extracted from program source code. Firstly, it gathers all syntactic knowledge that should be learned by the students by extracting SKP from the source code in teaching materials or exercises' model answers. Then, for each student, it collects his learning activities on each SKP by extracting SKP from the source code the student have read or taught at lectures and wrote at exercises or tests. Finally, for each student, his understanding of each SKP is estimated based on the collected data. Student learning status can be described by his understanding of all SKPs. By SKP-based SLSD, the information used to describe student learning status can be more detail, be better-defined and better-handled by computer systems.

Manufacturers of portable computers have an opportunity to win public praise and to avoid censure and liability by embracing green design and sensible product disposal systems. This paper analyzes the environmental issues associated with disposal, re-use and recycling of these machines, focusing on potential design changes to alleviate environmental burdens. Portable computers can replace larger machines, resulting in lower energy use and lower overall material demand. Since the number of portable computers purchased may be as many as 100 million over the next decade, environmental concerns become increasingly important. Portable computers use batteries with toxic components, so there are disposal or recycling problems. Another significant issue in assessment of disposal and recycling processes is the expected life time of portable computers. Machine design with capability for easy upgrade can be expected to have a longer useful life.

Curriculum Design and Evaluation for Introductory Computer Science Course,P. -C. Lin,"Department of Electrical Engineering, Yuan Ze University, Taoyuan, Taiwan",2022 IEEE 5th Eurasian Conference on Educational Innovation (ECEI),20-Jul-22,2022,"Common curriculum designs for introductory computer science courses consist of various topics, but those topics are quite noncoherent. Due to the non-coherence, students would have great difficulty in understanding the relationship between the natural language of the problem and the electron flow in the devices inside a computer. In this paper, we present the coherent curriculum design of this course. We first introduce the levels of transformation, including problem description, algorithm, programming languages, instruction set architecture (ISA), microarchitecture, circuits, and devices, from top to bottom. Based on the levels of transformation, students obtain a whole picture of how a problem is solved by the devices inside a computer. Then students learn the structure of a computer. We adopt an educational ISA, the LC3, to form the foundation of this coherent curriculum design. Based on the LC3 ISA, students learn to write machine language programs and assembly language programs and run those programs in the LC3 microarchitecture. We also adopt a GUI-based LC3 simulator to demonstrate the information flow in the LC3 data path. This helps students understand the detailed behavior of the computer hardware and software. We evaluate the proposed coherent curriculum design based on students' performance and questionnaire. The evaluation results show the effectiveness of the proposed coherent curriculum design. The coherent curriculum design improves students' final scores. The mean scores of coherent curriculum design outperform the ones of noncoherent curriculum design.","[Computer Science, Introductory Computer Science Course, Curriculum Design, Coherent Curriculum]","[Computer science, Learning systems, Technological innovation, Microarchitecture, Instruction sets, Conferences, Natural languages]","[assembly language, computer aided instruction, computer science education, educational courses, engineering education, graphical user interfaces, instruction sets]",20-Jul-22,IEEE

These workers walk around a very large, very loud, football field-sized plant and take food samples at various processing points. The workers pick up a sample, make a measurement (for example, temperature), wipe their hands on a paper towel, then use a pen and clipboard to write the measurement on a paper inspection form. At the end of the shift, the quality assurance inspectors give their paper forms to the quality assurance manager. For other members of the management team (such as the plant manager) to see the inspection data, the forms must be photocopied or the data must be typed into a networked computer. We faced several challenges in our effort to improve the performance of the quality assurance inspectors. The inspectors need a data collection system that is portable and allows inspectors to enter data without using their hands. The system must also provide the data to the plant management team as the inspectors actually gather the data. Finally, the use of sound to enter or receive information is a major challenge in the plant's noisy environment.",,"[Wearable computers, Quality assurance, Inspection, Application software, Wireless networks, Computer network management, Computer networks, Headphones, Temperature measurement, Batteries]","[quality control, data acquisition, portable computers, food processing industry]",06-Aug-02,IEEE

The non-perimeter network nodes, i.e. the computers with no direct internet connection, form a kind of isolated internet connected to the outside world through the perimeter nodes. All network nodes are assumed to process tasks based on the M/M/1 queuing model. Thus, the model behaves as an open network of M/M/1 queues. We study burst intrusions (e.g.denial of service attacks) at the network perimeter and how the intrusion evolves given that, in parallel with the intrusion, anti-virus tasks also propagate in the network and kill intruder tasks.

The objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between technological changes and the level of computer anxiety among employees in the commercial banks. Data were obtained through the survey method and were distributed randomly to the participants. 319 samples were analyzed in this study. The results reveal that some of the employees experience low levels of computer anxiety, but high levels of acceptance of computer applications. Additionally, statistical analysis shows small differences in computer anxiety scores among the executives and non-executives, younger-aged adults and middle-aged adults, and among the races and their levels of education. Using stepwise regression, the results indicate that the variables which determine the level of computer anxiety are composed of computer skills and acceptance of technology. Attitude towards computers are proven to have significant relationship on technological changes and on computer anxiety after running hierarchical regression. The above results suggest that computer users who experience computer anxiety are not anti-technology. With the presence of skills and knowledge when interacting with computers, they only need to manage their usage of the various computer applications in the workplace.

Computer-aided molecular design (CAMD) with force-torque feedback,"S. K. Lai-Yuen,  Yuan-Shin Lee","Department of Industrial Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA,  Department of Industrial Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA",Ninth International Conference on Computer Aided Design and Computer Graphics (CAD-CG'05),13-Mar-06,2005,This paper presents a new method for computer-aided molecular design (CAMD) and molecular assembly. A lab-built 5-DOF (degree of freedom) haptic device and the driving computational engine have been developed to provide force-torque feedback to the users for computer-aided molecular design (CAMD). An energy minimization method is proposed for finding collision-free molecular configurations in real-time for molecular docking and assembly. The proposed haptic force-torque feedback provides the users an intuitive tool for understanding the interactions among molecules. The presented techniques can be used in the computer-aided molecular design to provide the scientists or the designers a real-time intuitive guide for manipulating the ligand and understanding of the ligand's behavior towards the binding site of a receptor.

For systems involving users, user-centric design approaches are more appropriate. The ideation stage of design involves exploring the space of opportunities. One commonly held view in design disciplines is that quantity leads to quality. Yet, for related non-design disciplines such as engineering, quantity is often regarded as a negative characteristic associated with low quality. Focusing on quality alone may lead to inferior user experience and ineffective systems. This study describes an initiative to (1) collect empirical evidence to support the design-belief that quantity leads to quality and (2) to use the activity and its results as part of a pedagogical strategy to enhance students' awareness of the connections between quantity and quality during ideation. A class of 100 computer science students was divided into two groups. Both groups were given the same task to design a text-input strategy for individuals with motor disabilities but with different focuses: one group was asked to focus on quality of ideas and the other group on the quantity of ideas. The results show that the students who focused on quantity of ideas produced better quality concepts compared to the students that focused on quality. The results were presented to and discussed with the students as a part of the learning process.","[ideation, sketching, universal design education, human computer interaction, text entry, motor disability]","[Focusing, Computer science, Solid modeling, Usability, Task analysis, Binary codes, Memory management]","[computer aided instruction, computer science education, engineering education, interactive systems, user interfaces]",21-Oct-19,IEEE

Computer security and air traffic automation,S. D. Smith,FAA National AIS,[1989 Proceedings] Fifth Annual Computer Security Applications Conference,06-Aug-02,1989,"Summary form only given. The author addresses the problem of whether it is possible to have an advanced automated air traffic system and still meet the safety concerns of both the controllers and system engineers as well as the computer security demands of the new Public Law 100-235, the Computer Security Act of 1987. Security has been an integral part of the planning for the advanced automation system, the air traffic control system. Yet, when the system design was still very young, automated security found itself neglected due to a fear that inclusion of a security package might deny access to a controller or system engineer in a time of urgent need. The solution was to develop a security package that would not cause such a denial of service.

This paper, that builds upon previous studies on EEG error-related signals, presents a hybrid approach for human computer interaction that uses human gestures to send commands to a computer and exploits brain activity to provide implicit feedback about the recognition of such commands. Using a simple computer game as a case study, we show that EEG activity evoked by erroneous gesture recognition can be classified in single trials above random levels. Automatic artifact rejection techniques are used, taking into account that subjects are allowed to move during the experiment. Moreover, we present a simple adaptation mechanism that uses the EEG signal to label newly acquired samples and can be used to re-calibrate the gesture recognition system in a supervised manner. Offline analysis show that, although the achieved EEG decoding accuracy is far from being perfect, these signals convey sufficient information to significantly improve the overall system performance.",,"[Electroencephalography, Gesture recognition, Brain modeling, Games, Human computer interaction, Accuracy, Brain computer interfaces]","[bioelectric potentials, brain-computer interfaces, calibration, computer games, decoding, electroencephalography, gesture recognition, medical signal processing, signal classification]",11-Nov-10,IEEE

Students on remote computers can draw various shapes and lines fully via hand tracking and the shapes are then simultaneously redrawn on the teacher's or student's computer. It uses Google's MediaPipe library for hand tracking and Node.js for server communication. The second application is a simple video game aimed primarily at preschool children. By playing the game, children learn basic shapes, colors and logical thinking. The application uses the handtrack.js library for hand-tracking and HTML/CSS with JavaScript for the base application.

The proposed virtual multimodal interface system provides vision-based mechanism to communicate between human and computer system rather than using conventional human computer interface. For motion tracking and recognition of eye and hand gesture we exploite optical flow method and template matching. In order to minimize the error to detected and track the specific human features caused by light variation, the enhancement of each frame is performed by histogram equalization and max-min normalization. For eye and hand region detection we use HT skin color which is nonparametric model and robust to light variation. While tracking the positions of hand and eye using optical flow method, predefined hand gesture and eye blinking are recognized by template matching.

This is valid for art and technical education, as well. One of the reasons is that education in computer visualization, especially in the area of 3D modeling, 3D animation, computer-generated special effects and programming for VR applications, is not the same as education for standard computer applications. From technical students it demands more creativity than usual technical subjects, like programming, or math. From art students it asks more technical knowledge and technical ability than they are usually required. The solution lies in changing the learning paradigm towards a flexible and differential approach.

To solve this problem, the testing method of computer vision algorithms using virtual scenes instead of real scenes has been applied. In this paper, Unity and robot operating system (ROS) are selected to build a virtual testing system named URCV for computer vision algorithms. The feasibility of the system and the influence of virtual scene elements on the testing of the monocular ORB_SLAM2 algorithm are verified, including the rendering path of Unity's RGB camera, texture accuracy, and illumination model.","[URCV, Unity, ROS, virtual testing, computer vision algorithms]","[Testing, Computer vision, Cameras, Rendering (computer graphics), Signal processing algorithms, Solid modeling, Engines]","[cameras, computer vision, image colour analysis, image texture, mobile robots, rendering (computer graphics), robot programming, robot vision, solid modelling, virtual reality]",23-Jan-20,IEEE

Online shopping has made the human life more easier and now user can feel the real shopping experience in virtual world of internet. As the popularity of e-commerce increases so the threats. Service providers and merchants who process credit card and debit card became the easy targets for computer hackers to steal information of cards and commit frauds. Nowadays merchants are providing many merchant facilitating employee to bring personnel devices and technology such as smart phones, laptop, etc. to simplify business and reduce capital expenditure, and opening a new site for fraud that can be committed by their own employees. In this paper we present the implementation of computer forensics to identify the source of for credit card fraud done by employee or internal people by USB devices.","[Data security, IT security, Computer Forensics, Credit card fraud investigation at merchant, Credit card fraud prevention, Frauds by USB devices, Data theft prevention]","[Credit cards, Reactive power, Universal Serial Bus, Computers, Electronic mail, Arrays, Forensics]","[auditing, computer crime, credit transactions, debit transactions, digital forensics, electronic money, fraud, Internet, peripheral interfaces, personnel, retail data processing]",12-Jun-14,IEEE

Computer Science Theory from a Practical Point of View,P. M. Maurer,"Dept. of Computer Science, Baylor University, Waco, TX",2021 International Conference on Computational Science and Computational Intelligence (CSCI),22-Jun-22,2021,"For the past several years, we at Baylor Computer Science, have been teaching a course entitled ""Foundations of Computer Science."" The objective of this course is to teach practical applications of mathematical machines, especially finite state machines and push-down automata. Undecidability and NP-Completeness are also covered. This course does not emphasize proofs and is not a substitute for a standard theory course. Instead, it is designed to give basic information about theoretical machines and their practical applications. The objective is to give students new tools for solving problems rather than presenting pure theory for its own sake.","[Theoretical Computer Science, Parsing, Finite State Machines]","[Computer science, Scientific computing, Education, Automata, Standards, Computational intelligence]","[computational complexity, computer aided instruction, educational courses, finite state machines, teaching]",22-Jun-22,IEEE

Gesture stroke recognition using computer vision and linear accelerometer,"En Wei Huang,  Li Chen Fu","Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taiwan,  Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taiwan",2008 8th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face & Gesture Recognition,10-Apr-09,2008,"In this paper we propose a method to recognize the arm motions performing within a short time, which are called “gesture strokes”, for instant interaction. We combine two modalities, computer vision and linear accelerometer, to obtain robust recognition results. The arm motion is first detected by the accelerometer, and a time window is created for this motion. Both modalities individually estimate the probability mass distribution of the gesture stroke classes from the information gathered inside this window. The estimation results of these two modalities are then combined by the dynamic model combination which is a log-linear combination with different weights for all probability masses. The set of weight exponents are learned by the Nelder-Mead method that minimizes the empirical error rate of classifying all training samples. The experiments show that these two modalities compensate for each other and the combination framework improves the recognition correct rate.",,"[Computer vision, Accelerometers, Wireless sensor networks, Acceleration, Motion detection, Human computer interaction, Control systems, Computer science, Robustness, Error analysis]","[accelerometers, computer vision, gesture recognition, human computer interaction, image classification]",10-Apr-09,IEEE
Simulation tools for computer communication networks,"M. Ilyas,  H. T. Mouftah","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, FL, USA,  Department of Electrical Engineering, Queen's University, Kingston, ONT, Canada",IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference and Exhibition. Communications for the Information Age,06-Aug-02,1988,The authors consider the issues related to the development of computer-aided analysis and design (CAAD) tools for computer communication networks. They describe a step-by-step procedure to develop a simulation tool and present a checklist of parameters that a computer network CAAD tool should have as a part of its output. Various methods of obtaining confidence intervals and their pros and cons are discussed. Generation of random numbers according to a given probability distribution function and their impact on confidence intervals are examined. Issues related to convergence of simulation results are addressed. The feasibility of hybrid CAAD tools (partly analytical and partly simulation) for computer communication networks is considered.<>,,"[Computational modeling, Computer simulation, Computer networks, Communication networks, Design automation, Computer aided analysis, Random number generation, Probability distribution, Convergence, Analytical models]","[CAD, computer aided analysis, computer networks, digital simulation, software tools]",06-Aug-02,IEEE
